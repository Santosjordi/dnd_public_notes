## **Sirius – The Guiding Flame (Human, Paladin)**  
> *"Even in the darkest woods, someone must carry the torch."*

**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Paladin (Oath of the Ancients - delayed)  
**Background:** Folk Hero  

---

## **Humble Origins**  
Sirius was born in **Rassalantar**, a hamlet nestled on the trade road between Waterdeep and Amphail. The village is safer than most, thanks to a rotating garrison of sixty Waterdhavian soldiers stationed in the local keep. His father, **Civilar Arthur**, commands the garrison, and his mother **Maria** manages the household with firm but loving grace. Sirius and his younger brother **Orion** grew up among soldiers and farmers, learning early to balance discipline with compassion.

## **The Folk Hero's First Trial**
Life in Rassalantar was steady—until a new patrol rotation brought a strange presence to the garrison. Among the fresh recruits was **Feela**, a strikingly beautiful and charismatic woman who quickly earned the admiration of the entire village. Everyone adored her—except Sirius.

From the moment they met, **something about her felt wrong**. It wasn't her words or her behavior—it was deeper, a gut feeling he couldn’t explain. A scentless, soundless wrongness that prickled at the edge of his awareness. He would later understand this as the awakening of his **Divine Sense**—the first spark of his paladin nature.

Time passed, and Feela grew ever more beloved by the community. Sirius, the sole dissenter, became the butt of jokes for his distrust. Yet he couldn’t shake the feeling, especially when he noticed Feela spending time with children in oddly secluded areas.

One fateful night, half the garrison was out patrolling and the rest had rotated back to Waterdeep. Sirius’ younger brother Orion vanished. His heart pounding, Sirius sounded the alarm. Together with his father and the two seasoned _armars_, **Blaskos Ulraven** and **Timmer Longschal**, they pursued Feela’s trail into the forest.

There, in a moonlit clearing encircled by glowing mushrooms, they found Feela—no longer hiding her nature. She stood at the heart of a **faerie ring**, lulling the stolen children to sleep. Her glamour peeled away, revealing a terrible truth: Feela was no mortal woman, but a **humanoid moth-like fae creature**, harvesting the children for some dark purpose beyond the veil.

It was Sirius who saw through her tricks and rallied the others to act. He fought with valor and clarity, resisting her enchantments and striking the decisive blow that broke her hold over the clearing. Though a few children had already crossed into the Feywild, **Sirius saved the rest**, including Orion. His bravery and conviction earned him the recognition of the entire village and the respect of the garrison, who no longer doubted his instincts.

## **The Awakening of the Paladin**
Haunted by his failure to save every child, Sirius committed himself to protecting others. He spent his late twenties fighting off bandits and raiders that threatened rural life along the trade routes. His bravery and selflessness stirred something deeper—**divine power began to flow through him**, not through study or rite, but through sheer will to do good.

His heroism caught the attention of a reclusive druid of the **Emerald Enclave**, a half-elf named **Kuthrus**, who saw promise in Sirius and offered him guidance. Though Sirius tried to walk the druidic path, his connection to the natural world was always filtered through something divine and luminous. Eventually, he swore himself to the **Oath of the Ancients**, vowing to be a guardian of life and light, and to uplift beauty and joy in the world.

## **The Fall of the Enclave**
For the next decade, Sirius became a cherished local hero: solving disputes, aiding the poor, and thwarting crime. He never killed if he could avoid it—preferring to subdue foes and negotiate with beasts through **Speak with Animals**. But then, a greater darkness loomed.

The forests around Rassalantar began to wither. Wildlife fled or sickened. The influence of the **Archfey Oberon**, once the Green Lord of blooming courts, had grown corrupt. His madness led him to extend his reach into the Material Plane. The **Emerald Enclave**, recognizing the threat, launched an incursion into the Feywild.

The campaign failed. Sirius, Kuthrus, and a handful of others were captured and then sentenced to death. But in a surprising twist, Oberon made a cruel offer instead of ending their lives:

> *“One of you shall bear the weight of my displeasure so the others may return. Offer me a volunteer, and the rest shall be released.”*

Sirius accepted the price and the burden. But the deal was treacherously worded: Oberon cursed Sirius with a mark that would sap his health, and, being true to his word, released Kuthrus’s soul from his body—**killing him before Sirius’ eyes**.

---

## **Redemption and Resolve**
Broken in spirit, Sirius left the Enclave and spent months in despair, his oath all but shattered. He wandered with Kallo, seeking smaller ways to help, until slowly, the light within him rekindled.

He eventually returned to the Enclave, full of contrition and renewed purpose. They accepted his plea. Now, Sirius once more carries the torch—not just for the Material Plane, but for those lost in the shadows of Oberon’s madness.
