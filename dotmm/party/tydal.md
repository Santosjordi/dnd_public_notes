**Race:** Human
**Class:** Rune Knight Fighter

**Backstory:**

* **Orphaned and Found:** Abandoned as an infant, Tydal was discovered by a family of noble Storm Giants: Thuztarn and Roldma. Believing him to be the subject of an ancient prophecy, they secretly raised him as their own.
* **The Prophecy:** The giants believed Tydal was the "stormborn" prophesied to break the Ordning (the giant caste system): *"From the bloodless line, stormborn shall rise—neither giant nor lesser, yet bearer of the sky’s crown. The storm shall break upon itself, and the chains of the Ordning shall fall."*
* **Secret Upbringing:** Tydal was raised in secret, learning the giants' language, history, and martial traditions. His adoptive father, Thuztarn, secretly trained him, while his adoptive mother, Roldma, nurtured him and taught him their lore.
* **Jealous Brother:** Tydal's adoptive brother, Altoj, deeply resented him, feeling overshadowed by the human child despite being a true giant.
* **Tragic Dragon Attack:** Their secluded life was destroyed when a black dragon attacked their home. Thuztarn and Roldma sacrificed themselves to protect Tydal and Altoj, hoping Tydal would fulfill the prophecy.
* **Blame and Doubt:** Altoj survived but blamed Tydal for their parents' death, vehemently denying his prophetic destiny. This left Tydal with internal conflicts and doubts.
* **Personality:**
    * **Initially Shy:** Due to his isolated upbringing, Tydal is shy and hesitant in new social situations.
    * **Friendly but Boundary-less:** Once comfortable, he becomes very friendly and enthusiastic but lacks understanding of personal boundaries due to his unusual upbringing.
* **Motivations:**
    * **Revenge:** To avenge his adoptive parents' deaths.
    * **Acceptance:** To build a new town where everyone is accepted, regardless of race or background.
    * **Self-Discovery:** To understand his place in the world and whether he is truly the subject of the prophecy.
* **Potential Future:** He may seek to climb the Ordning using a special artifact, like a belt of giant strength, to eventually break the system as foretold.

**Family:**

* **Father (Adoptive):** Thuztarn - A noble Storm Giant who fiercely protected Tydal and believed in the prophecy.
* **Mother (Adoptive):** Roldma - A wise Storm Giant who cared deeply for Tydal and taught him their history and traditions.
* **Brother (Adoptive):** Altoj - Bitter and jealous of Tydal, blaming him for their parents' death and vowing to prove he is not the prophesied one.

**Goals:**

* Become stronger to face future threats.
* Uncover the reason for the dragon attack.

## **The Lost Child.**  
Abandoned as an infant for reasons he may never know, Tydal's fate veered far from the ordinary. He was discovered by a noble family of Storm Giants—**Thuztarn**, the proud warrior-patriarch, and his wise partner, **Roldma**—deep in the high mountain aeries.

They found him not by chance, but by omen.  
An ancient prophecy, whispered in storm-tongue among the clouds, foretold:

> _“From the bloodless line, stormborn shall rise—  
> neither giant nor lesser, yet bearer of the sky’s crown.  
> The storm shall break upon itself,  
> and the chains of the Ordning shall fall.”_

To Thuztarn and Roldma, this tiny, vulnerable human child was not a burden—he was the key to a reckoning long overdue.

---

**The Hidden Heir.**  
Raising a “lesser” among giants was dangerous. To protect both Tydal and themselves, his adoptive parents kept his existence hidden from the outside world. He grew up in secret, deep within their storm-wreathed sanctuary.

Tydal was schooled in the ways of the giants:

- Their tongue, heavy with thunder.
    
- Their histories, carved into stone and sky.
    
- Their martial arts, both elegant and crushing.
    

Thuztarn trained him in secret, always with one eye on the prophecy. Roldma, ever nurturing, guided his education and growth, balancing fierce discipline with a mother’s warmth. She often chided him for his impulsiveness, but never once let him doubt that he was loved.

---

**The Shadow of a Brother.**  
Tydal always knew he was different—small, fragile, _other_.  
He bore this quietly, but not everyone in his adoptive family did.

His “brother,” **Altoj**, resented him bitterly. A true-blooded storm giant, Altoj struggled with the attention Tydal received and saw only insult in his presence. To Altoj, Tydal was an intrusion, not a brother—certainly not a prophesied savior.

Their rivalry simmered just below the surface… until the storm finally broke.

---

**The Fall.**  
A black dragon descended upon their sanctuary—its purpose unknown, its fury absolute. In the battle that followed, Thuztarn and Roldma fought to the last, sacrificing themselves so that their sons might escape.

They died believing in the prophecy.  
Believing in _him_.

Tydal and Altoj survived—but not together.  
Grief-stricken and furious, Altoj turned on Tydal, accusing him of causing their downfall.

> _“You’re no stormborn. You’re a mistake.”_

His words cut deeper than any claw. Doubt took root in Tydal’s heart, festering alongside guilt and pain.

---

**The Wanderer.**  
Now grown, Tydal walks a world he barely knows. Raised with a storm giant’s perspective but carrying a human’s heart, he exists between worlds.

- He is reserved, even shy—cautious from a life lived in secrecy.
    
- But when he opens up, his warmth is infectious.
    
- Social norms baffle him; he often oversteps boundaries or asks questions better left unspoken.
    
- He is curious, earnest, and kind—yet burdened by a destiny he’s unsure he deserves.
    

He fights to honor the memory of his parents, to prove the prophecy true, or at least _worth_ something. And more than that, he dreams of building a home—one where no one is judged by blood or bone, where anyone can belong.

In a world still bound by the chains of tradition and fear, **Tydal wants to break the storm wide open**.
