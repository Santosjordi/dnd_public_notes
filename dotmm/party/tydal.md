## **The Lost Child.**  
Abandoned as an infant for reasons he may never know, Tydal's fate veered far from the ordinary. He was discovered by a noble family of Storm Giants—**Thuztarn**, the proud warrior-patriarch, and his wise partner, **Roldma**—deep in the high mountain aeries.

They found him not by chance, but by omen.  
An ancient prophecy, whispered in storm-tongue among the clouds, foretold:

> _“From the bloodless line, stormborn shall rise—  
> neither giant nor lesser, yet bearer of the sky’s crown.  
> The storm shall break upon itself,  
> and the chains of the Ordning shall fall.”_

To Thuztarn and Roldma, this tiny, vulnerable human child was not a burden—he was the key to a reckoning long overdue.

**The Hidden Heir.**  
Raising a “lesser” among giants was dangerous. To protect both Tydal and themselves, his adoptive parents kept his existence hidden from the outside world. He grew up in secret, deep within their storm-wreathed sanctuary.

Tydal was schooled in the ways of the giants:

- Their tongue, heavy with thunder.
    
- Their histories, carved into stone and sky.
    
- Their martial arts, both elegant and crushing.
    

Thuztarn trained him in secret, always with one eye on the prophecy. Roldma, ever nurturing, guided his education and growth, balancing fierce discipline with a mother’s warmth. She often chided him for his impulsiveness, but never once let him doubt that he was loved.

---

**The Shadow of a Brother.**  
Tydal always knew he was different—small, fragile, _other_.  
He bore this quietly, but not everyone in his adoptive family did.

His “brother,” **Altoj**, resented him bitterly. A true-blooded storm giant, Altoj struggled with the attention Tydal received and saw only insult in his presence. To Altoj, Tydal was an intrusion, not a brother—certainly not a prophesied savior.

Their rivalry simmered just below the surface… until the storm finally broke.

---

**The Fall.**  
A black dragon descended upon their sanctuary—its purpose unknown, its fury absolute. In the battle that followed, Thuztarn and Roldma fought to the last, sacrificing themselves so that their sons might escape.

They died believing in the prophecy.  
Believing in _him_.

Tydal and Altoj survived—but not together.  
Grief-stricken and furious, Altoj turned on Tydal, accusing him of causing their downfall.

> _“You’re no stormborn. You’re a mistake.”_

His words cut deeper than any claw. Doubt took root in Tydal’s heart, festering alongside guilt and pain.

**The Wanderer.**  
Now grown, Tydal walks a world he barely knows. Raised with a storm giant’s perspective but carrying a human’s heart, he exists between worlds.

- He is reserved, even shy—cautious from a life lived in secrecy.
    
- But when he opens up, his warmth is infectious.
    
- Social norms baffle him; he often oversteps boundaries or asks questions better left unspoken.
    
- He is curious, earnest, and kind—yet burdened by a destiny he’s unsure he deserves.
    

He fights to honor the memory of his parents, to prove the prophecy true, or at least _worth_ something. And more than that, he dreams of building a home—one where no one is judged by blood or bone, where anyone can belong.

In a world still bound by the chains of tradition and fear, **Tydal wants to break the storm wide open**.

- Caught between cultures: **thinks like a giant, feels like a human**—socially awkward but deeply earnest.

---

### 🧩 **Key Backstory Elements (For GM Hooks)**
- **Prophecy as Plot Hook:**  
  *"From the bloodless line, stormborn shall rise…”*  
  Giants or scholars may recognize or debate this prophecy. Tydal could become a political flashpoint in giant society.

- **Dragon Attack Mystery:**  
  A black dragon destroyed his adoptive home. Its motive is unknown. Was it targeting the prophecy? The family? Tydal?

- **Rival Brother – Altoj (Antagonist Potential):**  
  Survived the attack. Bitter, powerful, and convinced Tydal is *not* the chosen one. May become a recurring nemesis or tragic foil.

---

### 🎭 **Personality Snapshot**
- **Socially Hesitant:** Shy in new groups; slow to trust.
- **Disarmingly Friendly:** Becomes overly familiar once comfortable—asks invasive questions, struggles with norms.
- **Outsider Perspective:** Uses giant idioms, prioritizes honor, thinks in hierarchies.

---

### 🎯 **Motivations (for Dynamic Roleplay)**
1. **Vengeance:** Aims to avenge Thuztarn and Roldma’s deaths—especially if the dragon reappears.
2. **Belonging:** Dreams of founding a town where all are welcome—no caste, no prejudice.
3. **Prophecy/Power:** Wants to *earn* his destiny—may seek ancient relics (e.g., Belt of Storm Giant Strength) or giant trials to “prove” himself.

---

### 🧠 **Internal Conflict**
- **Self-Doubt vs. Destiny:**  
  Tydal is unsure whether he *is* the chosen one—or just someone giants wanted to believe in. His brother’s accusations weigh heavily.

---

### 🧬 **Useful NPC Connections**
- **Thuztarn (Adoptive Father, Deceased):** Noble warrior, secretly trained Tydal in martial traditions. Could appear in visions, dreams, or via relics.
- **Roldma (Adoptive Mother, Deceased):** Scholar and caregiver. Taught Tydal history and prophecy. Her journals or teachings may resurface.
- **Altoj (Adoptive Brother, Alive):** Potential villain or rival. Resents Tydal, seeks to disprove the prophecy. Could be a pawn, antagonist, or eventual ally.

---

### 🧭 **Adventure Hooks for Integration**
- **Prophecy Debate:** Storm Giant society is split—some view Tydal as a savior, others as a heresy. He might be hunted or hailed.
- **Draconic Secrets:** The dragon that destroyed his family may tie into a deeper plot—perhaps it feared the prophecy, or was working for a rival faction.
- **The Climb of the Ordning:**  
  Tydal may literally or metaphorically ascend the giant caste system, using deeds, relics, or diplomacy to challenge ancient order.
