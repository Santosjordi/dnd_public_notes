### Log

After successfully slaying a group of marauding manticores near Neverwinter, the party found themselves in a local tavern, celebrating with ale and laughter. 
Hired by a local noble whose livestock had fallen victim to the beasts, they basked in the temporary peace after the battle. However, their victory was overshadowed by the grim rumors swirling through the tavern—a tale of disappearances and abductions haunting the city.

It was here that Vincent, whos visage is a thing to behold, found himself facing suspicion. “Undead are not welcome in this establishment,” the tavernkeep warned him, eyeing him warily.

“I am very much alive,” Vincent countered with a sharp grin, dismissing the concern with casual arrogance. The tavernkeep, either easily convinced or disinterested in pressing the issue, backed down, but Essen, ever-watchfull, couldn't help but tease his companion.

“Why did she believe you so easily?" Essen remarked, leaning back in his chair with a smirk. "At least let me take part in the explanation. She was hot, dude.”

Their lighthearted banter would be short-lived, as soon after a clerk brought a message, they are being summoned with utmost haste to Castle Never.

As they are lead into the terrace of the recently reformed wing of the Castle, they see a crowd of fancy dressed nobles chattering amongst themselves, as the party approaches the crowd, the clerk leaves them, and notifies the Lord of the adventurers arrival.

Dagult Neverember stands at the edge of a beautifully crafted gazebo that crowns a terrace, his silhouette framed against the distant peak of Mount Hotenow. He adjusts the collar of his richly embroidered tunic, the intricate patterns catching the warm light of the setting sun. As his gaze sweeps over the assembled nobles, their silks and jewels glimmer in the fading light, a plume of smoke curls lazily from the volcano in the distance, painted in fiery hues of orange and crimson. With a confident smile, Dagult raises a hand, commanding silence from the crowd.

"My esteemed friends, your fears are not misplaced, but let me assure you that the situation is well in hand. Lady Indrina and the other... absconded nobles have not vanished without trace. 
The Church of Oghma, ever diligent, has presented us with a lead—a strong one, I might add—on their whereabouts. And I have taken it upon myself to ensure that the matter is resolved with the utmost efficiency."

He pauses, allowing the weight of his words to settle, his smile growing as he gestures toward the adventurers standing near the entrance.

"These fine individuals—seasoned, battle-hardened—have been retained for just such a task. They are no strangers to danger, and I am certain they will most certainly see this through. After all, we don’t just hire... anyone."

Neverember’s eyes flick momentarily toward the adventurers, as if sizing them up.

"And of course, they will not be going alone. The Heganbor brothers, a renowned company of Dwarven fighters, will lend their formidable strength to this rescue effort. 
Together, they will root out these miscreants, bring back Lady Indrina and her peers, and restore the peace we so richly deserve."

He takes a slow step forward, addressing the room with a mix of arrogance and charm.

"Now, I understand some of you may have... reservations. But rest assured, I will see this resolved. For what other course is there, than to trust in the wisdom of my decisions? 
Neverwinter will be made whole once more, and we shall all sleep soundly in our estates, untroubled by the whims of petty criminals."

As the crowd forms into smallwrr groups, Lord Neverember spproaches the party. Essen, the silver harp of his secretive organization gleaming on his chest, approached with a bold request. 'My lord, I’d like to reach out to our... contact. And also, I’d like to investigate Lady Indrina’s residence,' he said, his voice faltering slightly as he met Dagult Neverember's piercing gaze.

Dagult, standing tall and impeccably composed, let a slow, almost amused smile play on his lips. 'Ah, a Harper,' he drawled, his tone smooth but edged with barely concealed contempt. 'I see. Well, no matter. Gregorio, please escort our heroes to the side-room while I tend to our other, more... esteemed guests.'

Essen’s face tightened, a flicker of unease crossing his features. He leaned toward Lyris, muttering under his breath, 'Did you catch that? Does he hate Harpers or just elves in general? Not that I’m one to judge—elves aren’t exactly my favorite either—but still, isn’t he supposed to be this polished diplomat from the Alliance? You’d think he’d be more civil.

The negotiations, as tense as they were, proceeded smoothly enough. Lyris, the party’s charismatic bard, worked his silver tongue, aiming to secure their payment.

“We want the equivalent in gold,” Lyris stated confidently, his words layered with charm.

The noble hesitated for a moment, then reluctantly agreed. “Very well, you can have the equivalent in gold.”

Essen, however, had a more altruistic request. “We don’t want an estate. I run an orphanage in Evereska, and half my income goes to the children there. They need a future.” His noble words earned a curious glance from the lord.

“We support orphanages,” the lord replied. “We have our fair share of them here, though there aren’t any children in them.”

A chill ran down Essen’s spine. The implication was too ominous. He kept silent but couldn’t help thinking dark thoughts: Do they sacrifice them? Starve them? Eat them? I’d better not push this further… I love my children too much.

The conversation shifted to the task at hand—why had the party been summoned? Reinforcements, it seemed, were needed, or at least that’s what the adventurers assumed.

Lord Neverember’s booming voice quickly corrected them, “You’re not reinforcements. You’re the main force.”

Essen scoffed under his breath. “If they couldn’t handle it, we’re clearly the cavalry,” he muttered. He couldn't resist adding, “I wonder what the Neverwinter Nine are doing—getting a tan somewhere? Maybe nevertan?”

As the party left the mansion, Essen couldn’t hold back his disdain. “I hate nobles,” he grumbled. “What I hated most about that guy? His speech—it was Neverending. Or should I say, Neverember-ending? Lyris, write that down for your joke book.”

Soon, their task took them to a cemetery. Their mission: to save a once-famous celebrity from the clutches of undeath. As they made their way through the eerily quiet graveyard, Essen’s dark humor resurfaced.

“We’re going to throw a funeral for people who refuse to acknowledge they’re dead,” he quipped. “It’s perfect—Neverliving in a Nevercemetery during Neverwinter Winter while we travel from Castle Never. Say never, and make the Nevermore Singing Lady sing!”

Their jokes quickly faded as they encountered the undead—clattering skeletons and ghoulish figures rising from the earth. Essen, always the trickster, took the battle lightly.

“I’m not getting serious yet. I expect more of a challenge deeper inside,” he mused, twirling his blade in one hand.

Merrick, the monk, remained calm, his stoic demeanor unshaken. “Patience is key, my dear apprentice,” he said, barely breaking a sweat as he dispatched the nearest skeleton.

Essen, clearly unimpressed, nudged Lyris. “Do you have a book of insults or something? Because I feel like this fight could use some spice.”

And with that, the party pressed deeper into the crypt, knowing that the true challenge lay ahead—but for now, at least, they still had time for a few more jokes.
