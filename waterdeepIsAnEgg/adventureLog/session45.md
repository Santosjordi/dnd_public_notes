### Log

The session begins in the "Foundry" level of Khundrukar, the last stronghold of Durgeddin’s extinct clan.

After celebrating their victory over Nightscale, the party lingers with the Kobolds, utilizing their tools to improve Zarragon's armor and attempting to complete one of the axes.

On the second day, it becomes apparent that the Kobolds are reluctant to continue hosting their guests. "We want to pack up and leave. Where do we exit? We entered through the chimney on the first level, but I'd prefer to avoid that climb if possible," says Gavlo.

"We came in through the Glitterhame, the mushroom cave," replies one of the Kobolds. "There is a tunnel leading into the cave, but it's closed by snow. Down by the black lake there is a path that leads into the underdark, we can take you there aswell if you want."

"No thanks, we'd very much like to avoid that. Can you show us the Glitterhame tunnel?" says Gavlo.

"Yes, come with me," the Kobold replies, leading the group back through the dwarven statue room and into the Glitterhame. The cave glows with the phosphorescence of the mushrooms. On the far side, the party sees a group of Troglodytes hauling an Umber Hulk carcass.

"Don't bother them, and you're good," says the guide. "We have an agreement with them."

"Those things talk?" asks Zarragon.

"Yes, for some reason they speak a crude Draconic. Go figure," the guide shrugs.

"Here, this was the cave made by the orcs during the siege of Khundrukar. If you're in a hurry to leave, you can try digging it out," the guide continues.

"No need," says Gavlo, casting "Flaming Sphere." A small orange sphere bathes the wall of the tunnel in light before he shoves it into the snow. A cloud of vapor soon fills the space, and water starts pooling at everyone’s feet. Within a minute, a clear and slippery tunnel through the snow leads into a gray day outside.

"Well, thanks for having us. If you come by the Dock Ward in Waterdeep, look for me at Weirdbottle’s Concoctions," says Gavlo.

"Will do," answers the Kobold.

The group breathes in the fresh, cold air of the mountain. Sersh surveys the landscape, "We are to the east of the mountain," and pulls out Harek’s map from the bag of holding. Zarragon and Gavlo join in, reading the rich dwarf's documents.

"We can try to take the most straightforward path possible. I think Harek was either stupid or trying to lose anyone trying to follow us to Khundrukar," Gavlo writes in his journal. "Dwarves are stupid—oh wait, I already wrote that."

"It should take us around nine days to get back to Mirabar if we go straight south and then just follow the river," says Sersh.

"Guys, I think we may have a problem," says Zarragon, pointing at three figures circling the mountain in the sky.

Gavlo observes them for a minute before saying, "Fucking Volo. I thought it was just another tall tale, but it seems you were not lying."

"What is it?" asks Vega.

"I don’t remember the name, but the orc clans of the Galena Mountains use some sort of giant bat as mounts."

"Well, there are only three of them. Shouldn't be a problem. Let's go," says Vega as the party starts their descent down the Stone Tooth.

Vega uses his "Create Food and Water" divine spell to keep the party fed and Leomund's Tiny Hut to create a comfortable shelter. On their third day of travel, the group passes what seems to be an abandoned farm, with a large stretch of frozen grassland and little to no trees in sight for a few kilometers. Just before reentering the tundra-like forest of pine trees, a blanket of darkness envelops everyone in the middle of the day.

Zarragon’s supernatural sight discerns the attackers—three short orcs mounted on wolves with bat wings. They pelt Vega with darts before dashing away. Zarragon misty steps Vega outside the magical darkness, then uses his eldritch prowess to paralyze the riders. Vega tries to take flight after them, but to no avail, as the wolves fly their riders to safety before the party can retaliate.

Gavlo uses healing magic on Vega before the party cautiously resumes their journey. The same ambush occurs three more times during the day. Vega notices a pattern: as the party strays eastward, the orcs attack, but they travel uncontested westward.
