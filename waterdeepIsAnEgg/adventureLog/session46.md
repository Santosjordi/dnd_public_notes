### Log
The session commenced in the wilds north of the River Mirar, some fifty kilometers from Mirabar. Harried by repeated ambushes from orcs mounted on Grymskyrs, the party resolved to parley with their relentless foes.

"I'll use a message spell," said Sersh. "When they get close enough, that is."

"Good idea," replied Vega. "Perhaps we can discover why they are bent on our destruction."

After biding their time, the orcs drew nearer, within the range of Sersh's magic. "Why are you attacking us? What do you want?" Sersh's voice, carried by the spell, reached the startled orc. Still astride his grim mount, the orc took a moment to comprehend before bellowing in Orcish, "YOU KILLED OUR FAMILY, SLAUGHTERED OUR CHILDREN, AND STILL ASK WHAT I WANT? I WANT YOUR GUTS!"

"Oh, that. They are from the same clan, Vega," noted Gavlo.

"From the Stone Tooth?" the Aasimar responded.

Zarragon nodded in grim remembrance, recalling the whelps—collateral damage of Vega's Spirit Guardians spell—consigned to the pyre along with their parents.

A swift skirmish ensued, the orcs pelting Gavlo with darts before fleeing beyond the party's reach.

"We can't sustain this," said Sersh. "They'll wear us down."

"Agreed," the party concurred. "Let us proceed cautiously and find a place to ambush them."

No further ambushes occurred as night approached. Vega invoked Leomund's Tiny Hut, conjuring a sanctuary against the mountain's chill winds. The party woke around three in the morning, refreshed. Zarragon scouted and discovered a disturbed area some 300 feet from their camp. "They were here but couldn't find us. Good," thought Zarragon.

"They've lost us. We can press on through the night and maybe shake them off our trail for good," Zarragon informed the party. All agreed, and they resumed their trek in the darkness. With eyes enhanced by magic, they navigated the forest with ease, making significant progress despite occasional dead ends.

After four more hours of hiking, they glimpsed the River Mirar and the vast expanse of the Lurkwood on the opposite bank. Emerging from the trees onto a large rocky mesa, they found themselves exposed. 
Within minutes, the Grymskyr-riding orcs descended upon them, and the party prepared to face their foes once more.

Vega shouted, "It's Morbin Time!" as Helm's blessing washed over him, surrounding him in a soft glow that dimmed the light around. He took flight, his shadowsteel halberd glinting, his eyes glowing with the radiance of the heavens. The orcs drew closer, invoking Shargaas's dark blessing, bathing their foes in darkness and hurling darts at Gavlo and Sersh.

Sersh, escaping the dark cloud, called upon his sorcerous power to lash the minds of the Grymskyrs. The wolf-bat hybrids whimpered in pain but continued their assault. The magical darkness did not hinder Zarragon, who unleashed eldritch rays upon the orcs.

Vega closed in on the nearest flying Grymskyr, lunging with his glaive. The blade bit into the creature's shoulder, causing it to howl in pain before collapsing in midair, dragging its rider down in a thirty-foot fall. The orc barely had time to scramble away from his dead mount before Zarragon appeared beside him with a misty step, slashing a gaping wound across the orc's face. Gavlo, keeping a low profile, fired his crossbow, pelting the enemies with bolts and healing his companions.

Summoning the spirits of the dead in a ghastly shroud, Vega charged the next rider, slashing his mount and sending it crashing to the ground in agony. Zarragon's opponent drew a scimitar, slashing at him before darting into the cloud of darkness. Zarragon followed, managing to kill him before he could attack Gavlo. "I command you to rise again!" Zarragon intoned, and the fallen foe's death throes gave way to a spectral apparition.

The second rider, fallen to the ground and seeing his mount writhing in pain, invoked Shargaas once more to cloak himself in darkness, buying precious moments.

Vega struck the third Grimskyr, sending it tumbling to the ground with his pitch-black glaive. Sersh hastened towards them, intercepting the rising orc who was preparing to throw darts at Vega. 

On the other side of the battlefield, Zarragon's specter suffered grievously as the Grimskyr and its orc rider ganged up on it. Zarragon and Gavlo swiftly finished off the wolf-bat hybrid. Meanwhile, Vega and Sersh's foe fled into the darkness, seeking to regroup with his ally. 

However, the orcs soon realized their predicament as the party surrounded them, quickly dispatching them with coordinated strikes.

"Well, let's make haste to Mirabar and hope this is the last of them." Says Sersh. 

The group traves uninpeded following the river Mirar downwards and manages to reach Mirabar in a few more days, they are greeted by the majestic silhouette of Mirabar as it looms ahead, 
its formidable walls standing as a testament to the city’s strength and resilience. The towering peaks surrounding the city are dusted with snow, their bases covered in dense forests that conceal 
numerous mines and hidden fortresses.

The group is able to enter the city with little query from the guards, as they just ask for their names, and where did they came from. 

The party then spreads around the city, looking for their own deals and agreeing to convey back to the "Hammer" tavern.
