### Log

The party wanders through the bustling streets of Yartar, asking locals about the Cassalanter villa. The city hums with gossip; they hear that the villa was attacked weeks ago and that the culprits—some humans and an ogrillon—were hanged in the town square shortly after. The once-stately villa has been abandoned, and the Cassalanters have since relocated to a secure manor in the heart of the city.

After a few wrong turns and some more asking around, they find the new Cassalanter residence—a grand, fortress-like manor set behind tall iron gates, guarded by a contingent of serious-looking men. A steady drizzle starts as they approach the imposing entrance, mud squelching underfoot as they trudge up the path.

The heavy doors creak open, revealing a sharp-eyed tiefling butler with crimson skin and pointed horns. He regards the group with an air of disdain. Vega steps forward, clearing his throat nervously.

“I-I need to d-deliver this p-parcel to, uh, O-Osvaldo Cassalanter,” Vega stammers, clutching the Iron Flask tightly.

The butler arches an eyebrow but nods slightly. “Very well. Come with me.” He turns on his heel and strides into the manor, not waiting to see if Vega follows.

The rest of the party lingers awkwardly in the grand foyer, eyeing the lavish decor and the numerous guards who stand watch. Vega trails behind the butler, who leads him down a spiraling staircase into the depths of the manor. Dim torches cast flickering shadows on the stone walls as they pass through several layers of security, each more stringent than the last. Vega fidgets nervously at every checkpoint, enduring the scrutinizing glares of the guards who pat him down and inspect the Flask.

Finally, they reach a heavily warded chamber deep underground. The air hums with magic, and glowing runes light the walls with a soft, eerie glow. At the far end stands a tall, gaunt tiefling with silver hair and piercing eyes—Osvaldo Cassalanter. His presence is intimidating, his long robes flowing like shadows around him.

Osvaldo’s gaze locks onto Vega. “You have something for me?” he asks, his voice smooth but cold.

“Y-yes, sir,” Vega mumbles, his voice catching. He steps forward, carefully handing the Iron Flask over. “I w-was t-told to deliver this, uh, to you, s-sir.”

Osvaldo takes the Flask with an unreadable expression, turning it over in his hands as if weighing its secrets. Without a word, he turns and disappears through a heavily warded door at the back of the chamber. Vega stands awkwardly, glancing around the room where the magical wards seem to pulsate in time with his racing heart.

From behind the closed door, Vega catches snippets of a conversation, muffled but distinct—a woman’s voice speaking in hushed, urgent tones. Vega shifts on his feet, straining to hear but unable to make out the words clearly. After a tense few minutes, Osvaldo returns, the Flask no longer in sight.

Osvaldo fixes Vega with a cold stare. “Your compensation has been arranged?”

Vega nods quickly. “Y-yes, sir, it’s a-all sorted.”

Osvaldo nods curtly. “Good. That will be all.” He gestures to the butler, who steps forward to escort Vega back up the winding stairs. They walk in silence, Vega’s mind swirling with questions he knows better than to ask.

Back in the entrance hall, the butler opens the door to the overcast, rain-dappled street. Vega re-joins the party, who immediately bombard him with curious looks.

“Well? What happened?” one of them asks, unable to hide their impatience.

Vega shakes his head, still rattled. “L-later,” he mutters, glancing back at the manor as the doors swing shut behind him. He tightens his cloak against the chill and steps back into the muddy streets of Yartar, the weight of the Cassalanter’s secrets heavy on his shoulders.
