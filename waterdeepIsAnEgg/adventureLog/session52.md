### Log
The party arrives at a sleepy, unnamed village nestled on the muddy banks of the Surbrin River. The village itself is little more than a handful of wooden huts with thatched roofs, but the riverside is a hive of activity. Multiple tents are pitched haphazardly around the area, filled with restless travelers and merchants waiting their turn to board the barge downriver to Yartar. The air is thick with the smell of wet earth and the constant hum of idle chatter, mixed with the occasional clatter of weapons as mercenaries and adventurers practice their craft to pass the time.

As the party moves through the muddy encampment, they catch snippets of conversation about the upcoming Spring Hiring Festival in Yartar. It’s a grand event that draws aspiring mercenaries, adventurers, and all sorts of rogues and peddlers eager to show off their skills in competitions, hoping to attract potential employers. They also hear wild rumors about the new Waterbaron of Yartar, an eccentric man known for his bizarre fondness for tigers and anything related to them—statues, tapestries, even his attire is said to be adorned with tiger stripes.

In the midst of the bustling camp, they find a small tent with colorful banners flapping in the breeze, marking it as the stall of a scroll merchant named Ba-Chim. The merchant, a wiry man with a perpetual smile and a glint of cunning in his eyes, gestures them inside.

“Welcome, travelers! Interested in some magic?” Ba-Chim says, spreading his arms wide to display a collection of scrolls laid out on a worn rug. “Got scrolls of all kinds—protection, offense, a little trickery, if that’s your thing.”

The party browses the scrolls, picking out several that catch their eye. As they finalize their purchases, Ba-Chim leans in, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “I’ve got a proposition for you. I need to get to The Serene Guild of Seers, Augurs, Runecasters, and Wainwrights in Yartar, but it’s not exactly safe to travel alone these days. You escort me, and I’ll make it worth your while.”

Vega crosses his arms, raising an eyebrow. “How worth our while?”

Ba-Chim grins, tapping his nose. “I’ve got a spot on the next barge out of here. If you’re with me, you won’t have to wait days in this mud pit. I pay you in transport—no coin, but a quick ride to Yartar. What do you say?”

The party exchanges glances, considering the offer. Zarragon shrugs. “Better than waiting here, and we’re headed that way anyway.”

Sersh nods. “Alright, Ba-Chim, you’ve got yourself a deal.”

The merchant claps his hands together. “Excellent! We leave first thing in the morning. Make sure you’re ready—I’ve no intention of missing that barge.”

As night falls, the party sets up camp near Ba-Chim’s tent, the flickering firelight casting long shadows across the damp ground. The village quiets, save for the occasional snort of a horse or the soft murmur of distant conversations. The promise of Yartar and the festival ahead stirs a restless anticipation among the travelers.

Come morning, the sun breaks through the clouds, casting a pale light over the river. The barge, a long, sturdy vessel with a weathered crew, is already being loaded with goods and travelers alike. Ba-Chim ushers the party onboard, his face beaming with satisfaction.

“Yartar, here we come!” he declares, as the barge pushes off from the muddy banks and begins its slow journey down the Surbrin, the village shrinking behind them into the mist.
