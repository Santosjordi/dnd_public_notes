### Log
The party arrives at Yartar, a bustling city that sprawls across the river's intersection, alive with activity as preparations for the Hiring Fair are in full swing. The streets are filled with a swirl of colors and sounds—vendors hawking their wares, musicians playing lively tunes, and the smell of roasted meats and fresh bread filling the air. Ba-Chim, in his fine landsknecht attire, offers to have his servants tend to the party's horses while they accompany him—and a heavily fortified box—to the Guild of Seers. The party agrees, and they make their way through the crowded, cobblestone streets.

Ba-Chim leads them towards the purple-spired compound of the Serene Guild of Seers, Augurs, Runecasters, and Wainwrights. The compound is a grand, eclectic mix of towering spires and workshop-filled courtyards. As they approach the main gate, the outer courtyard is filled with a cacophony of voices—apprentice seers clad in simple robes shout over one another, peddling cheap fortunes and questionable prophecies to eager onlookers.

“Stay close,” Ba-Chim warns, his eyes scanning the crowd. “And try not to get roped into any of their nonsense.”

They push through the throng, entering the inner courtyard where the noise level somehow increases. Journeymen wainwrights hammer away at wagons, loudly repairing and reinforcing wheels and axles. The smell of sawdust and burning incense mingles in the air—a strange but fitting blend for a guild that marries the mystical with the practical.

Inside, the atmosphere changes abruptly. They step into the cool, dark confines of the inner sanctum, a stark contrast to the chaos outside. The room is dimly lit, with only the flicker of candlelight reflecting off stone walls. Ba-Chim’s eyes, sharp and elfin, quickly adjust to the gloom. Ahead, a white-robed woman sits on a tall-backed, bronze-enameled chair suspended over a vapor-filled chasm. The air is thick and still, broken only by the quiet murmur of her conversation with a blue-clad attendant.

As Ba-Chim steps forward, the oracle's demeanor shifts. She begins to writhe and moan theatrically, her movements erratic and unsettling. The attendant steps forward, taking the sacks of gold from Ba-Chim’s outstretched hands. Suddenly, a booming, hollow voice resonates from above.

“WHAT DO YOU SEEEEEK?”

Ba-Chim stands tall, unfazed by the display. “Where is the tip of the sword Fauxbringer located, and what must be done to restore the sword to its full powers?”

The oracle begins to sway dramatically, her voice rising in an unsettling chant: “VIAKHANA Xitchol! Serpadon! Cuccagna! NATAS!” She pauses, then continues in a flat monotone, “What is a stick that is not a stick? When is a rock not—”

The blue-clad attendant quickly interrupts, whispering urgently to the oracle. Ba-Chim catches snippets of “full rate” amidst the attendant’s stage whisper. The oracle suddenly ceases her performance, her voice shifting to a clear, almost casual tone.

“Oh, well, you can find the sword in the underground level under the Tower of the Master in the western part of the Anauroch desert. Cirl the Petulant left it sitting on a worktable right next to the magical forge that can repair it. Cirl was slain for reneging on a gambling debt by a blue-skinned giant, apparently before he could complete his task.”

Without missing a beat, she concludes with a curt, “Next!”

The party, taken aback by the abrupt change in demeanor, is ushered out by the attendant. As they step back into the bustling courtyard, Ba-Chim leans in, speaking in a hushed voice. “I trust that you won’t disclose the oracle's words to anyone? Great, then thanks for everything! Remember to come by to retrieve your horses!”

The party watches as Ba-Chim disappears into the crowd, his now ampty box safely in tow. Vega turns to the group, a thoughtful expression on his face. “We need to find information on the Cassalanter family. I have… business with them. Idalla requires me to deliver a parcel.”

The party exchanges wary glances but nods in agreement. With the oracle’s cryptic words still echoing in their minds, they set off through the muddy streets of Yartar, the city’s lively chaos a stark contrast to the uncertain path ahead.
