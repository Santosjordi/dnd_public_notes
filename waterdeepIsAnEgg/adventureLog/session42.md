### Log
The session unfurled within the darkened depths of the 'Foundry' level, nestled deep within the ruins of Durgedin's fortress. As the party ventured forth, guided by Vega's unwavering zeal, they encountered a relentless horde of undead, stirred from their eternal slumber by the intruders' presence.

With a fervent cry, Vega surged forward, leading the charge against the skeletal adversaries. His voice reverberated with divine authority as he summoned forth his Spiritual Weapon, a lance of radiant energy, and raised his shield emblazoned with the holy symbol of Helm. "By the powers of Helm, begone to your final rest!" he declared, unleashing a wave of radiant light that engulfed the undead horde, reducing half of their number to mere ashes.

Yet, amidst the chaos of battle, some of the skeletons managed to evade the divine onslaught, closing in on Vega with relentless determination. Undeterred, the Aasimar warrior braced himself against the onslaught, facing the relentless barrage of attacks from all sides. The heavy blows of an Ogre Skeleton's club and the sharp strikes of rusty dwarven axes tested Vega's resilience as he stood firm, a stalwart bastion against the encroaching darkness.
In the rear of the group, Gavlo's voice pierced the tumult of battle, his words laced with determination. "Sersh, I'm gonna make you big," he announced, his hands weaving arcane energies as he cast Enlarge upon the towering half-orc paladin. With newfound stature, Sersh loomed over the undead horde, a formidable force against the encroaching darkness.

Emboldened by Gavlo's magic, Sersh and Zarragon surged forward, unleashing devastation upon the ranks of the undead. Their coordinated assault brought a momentary respite to Vega, who, fueled by his remaining divine energy, invoked the power of Helm to turn the remaining undead. "Begone foul creatures! Helm compels you into the twilight's rest!" he proclaimed, and once more, a radiant wave of energy scattered the undead, reducing them to naught but tattered remnants of their former selves.

Yet, amidst the victory, an ominous chill swept over Gavlo as he felt a cold touch upon his back. Before he could react, his consciousness faltered, slipping away momentarily. As he turned to confront the source of the disturbance, his eyes widened in dread as he beheld an angry spectral dwarf, clad in classical magician robes, its visage twisted into a horrifying semblance. With a flurry of movement, the ghostly apparition lunged towards Gavlo, its ethereal claws reaching out hungrily.

Meanwhile, Sersh's heart quickened with fear as he caught sight of the ghostly specter, instinctively moving away from its chilling presence. Unaware of the looming danger, Vega and Zarragon remained focused on dispatching the remnants of the undead horde. Gavlo, deftly evading the ghost's attacks, retaliated with a barrage of magical crossbow bolts, each strike weakening the specter's insubstantial form.

Sensing their friend's peril, Zarragon and Sersh turned back to aid Gavlo, their weapons flashing with determination. Together, they confronted the ghostly intruder, their combined efforts gradually wearing down its spectral defenses. With a final flurry of strikes, the ghostly form began to fade, retreating into the ethereal plane in a desperate bid for escape.

Yet, as the specter sought refuge in the realm beyond, it found itself ensnared by unseen forces, its demise swift and merciless as two ominous hands materialized from the darkness, tearing the ghost apart with ruthless efficiency.
