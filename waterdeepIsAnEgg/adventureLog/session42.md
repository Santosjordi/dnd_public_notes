### Log
The session commenced at the 'Foundry' level of Durgedin's fortress ruins. The party follows Vega's fervent charge against the horde of undead, the creatures now standing after being woken up from their slumber by the invaders. Vega summons his Spiritual Weapon in the shape of a lance, raises his shield imbued with with Helm's Holy symbol and shouts "By the powers of Helm, begone to your final rest!" as a wave of radiant divine light washes over the undead, turning half of the horde into ashes, and sending a few of them running, before skewering the closest skeleton and shattering it. The remaining skeletons, unaffected by the divinity displayed charge the Aasimar, charge the party surrounding vega who takes some mighty blows from a Ogre Skeletons club and rusty dwarven axes from all sides.
Gavlo on the rear of the group says "Sersh, I'm gonna make you big" and casts Enlarge into the half-orc paladin, who now towers over most of the undead. Sersh and Zarragon proceeds to lay waste to the undead horde, bringing respite to Vega's situation, who immediately uses his remaining divine energy to turn the remaining undead "Begone foul creatures! Helm compels you into the twilight's rest!" and once again a wave of radiance scatters the undeath from the corpses, reducing them to rags and tattered armor, decayed weapons. Gavlo feels a cold touch on his back, his counsciousness slips away from a second before he is able to regain his composure, whe he looks behind there is an angry spectral dwarf with classical magician robes, angrily shouting in dwarvish before transforming into an Horrifying visage, fear grips Sersh's heart who moves away from the ghostly appartion, while Vega and Zarragon, busy hunting the remaining creatures, don't take notice of the newcommer. Gavlo makes distance from the ghost and starts peppering it with magical crossbow bolts, while the magician moves close and trties to claw at Gavlo, but the kobold proves a slippery target. Zarragon turn back to help their friend while Sersh and Vega square of against the remnants of the horde. THe ghost's insubstantial form starts to fade from the magical weapon strikes, and it decides to slip into the ethereal plane, unfortunately, something there was waiting, as two long-fingered hands pierce the ghosts chest and rip it to shreds.
