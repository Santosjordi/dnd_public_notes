### Log
The session unfurled within the darkened depths of the 'Foundry' level, nestled deep within the ruins of Durgedin's fortress. As the party ventured forth, guided by Vega's unwavering zeal, they encountered a relentless horde of undead, stirred from their eternal slumber by the intruders' presence.

With a fervent cry, Vega surged forward, leading the charge against the skeletal adversaries. His voice reverberated with divine authority as he summoned forth his Spiritual Weapon, a lance of radiant energy, and raised his shield emblazoned with the holy symbol of Helm. "By the powers of Helm, begone to your final rest!" he declared, unleashing a wave of radiant light that engulfed the undead horde, reducing half of their number to mere ashes.

Yet, amidst the chaos of battle, some of the skeletons managed to evade the divine onslaught, closing in on Vega with relentless determination. Undeterred, the Aasimar warrior braced himself against the onslaught, facing the relentless barrage of attacks from all sides. The heavy blows of an Ogre Skeleton's club and the sharp strikes of rusty dwarven axes tested Vega's resilience as he stood firm, a stalwart bastion against the encroaching darkness.
In the rear of the group, Gavlo's voice pierced the tumult of battle, his words laced with determination. "Sersh, I'm gonna make you big," he announced, his hands weaving arcane energies as he cast Enlarge upon the towering half-orc paladin. With newfound stature, Sersh loomed over the undead horde, a formidable force against the encroaching darkness.

Emboldened by Gavlo's magic, Sersh and Zarragon surged forward, unleashing devastation upon the ranks of the undead. Their coordinated assault brought a momentary respite to Vega, who, fueled by his remaining divine energy, invoked the power of Helm to turn the remaining undead. "Begone foul creatures! Helm compels you into the twilight's rest!" he proclaimed, and once more, a radiant wave of energy scattered the undead, reducing them to naught but tattered remnants of their former selves.

Yet, amidst the victory, an ominous chill swept over Gavlo as he felt a cold touch upon his back. Before he could react, his consciousness faltered, slipping away momentarily. As he turned to confront the source of the disturbance, his eyes widened in dread as he beheld an angry spectral dwarf, clad in classical magician robes, its visage twisted into a horrifying semblance. With a flurry of movement, the ghostly apparition lunged towards Gavlo, its ethereal claws reaching out hungrily.

Meanwhile, Sersh's heart quickened with fear as he caught sight of the ghostly specter, instinctively moving away from its chilling presence. Unaware of the looming danger, Vega and Zarragon remained focused on dispatching the remnants of the undead horde. Gavlo, deftly evading the ghost's attacks, retaliated with a barrage of magical crossbow bolts, each strike weakening the specter's insubstantial form.

Sensing their friend's peril, Zarragon and Sersh turned back to aid Gavlo, their weapons flashing with determination. Together, they confronted the ghostly intruder, their combined efforts gradually wearing down its spectral defenses. With a final flurry of strikes, the ghostly form began to fade, retreating into the ethereal plane in a desperate bid for escape.

Yet, as the specter sought refuge in the realm beyond, it found itself ensnared by unseen forces, its demise swift and merciless as two ominous hands materialized from the darkness, tearing the ghost apart with ruthless efficiency.

Only remnants of the horde remained, their once formidable ranks now shattered by the divine power unleashed by Vega. Those undead creatures still affected by the lingering aura of his holy energy cowered in the corners of the room, their strength sapped and their resolve broken. For the seasoned adventurers, they were nothing more than easy pickings, their defeat assured in the wake of the party's unwavering determination and prowess.

After a moment to catch their breath, Gavlo utilized the sensitivity of his boots to detect any movement on the other side of each door. Sersh grabs pieces of the less decayed dwarven armor "Zarragon, maybe we can stitch you a better armor", "I would like that, but we don't have the tools right now to fix those but might be worth holding onto them for a while".

With methodical precision, the party proceeded to ambush the creatures within each room, dispatching them with ruthless efficiency. As they cleared each chamber, only one door stood out—a remarkably ornate one, unlike the others, and firmly locked.

Sersh and Gavlo collaborated to pick the lock, their anticipation high for another round of clearing rooms. However, as the door swung open, they were met with an unexpected sight—a beautiful elven woman seated behind a desk, delicately handling a small crystal ball. Six sprites flitted around her office, clutching scrolls and taking cover behind towering stacks of books, clearly prepared for combat against the intruders. The room itself was adorned with cabinets brimming with scrolls, inkwells, and various other items one would expect to find in a wizard's sanctum. Positioned behind the elven woman was a mummified dwarf clad in wizard robes. She lifted her gaze momentarily and remarked, "You certainly are a noisy group, aren't you?".

Sersh opened his mouth to speak, but before he could utter a word, the elf raised a finger to her lips in a gesture of silence. She then proceeded to scribble furiously on the parchment spread out before her, her gaze never wavering from the mesmerizing depths of the crystal ball. Vega, growing increasingly irritated by the elf's dismissive behavior, unleashed the full force of his thaumaturgy-enhanced voice in protest. "LISTEN HERE, YOUNG LADY, I WON'T BE..." His words were abruptly cut off by the grumbling of the dwarven mummy, which seemed to cancel out the magical amplification of his voice. "...shushed by anyone!" Vega finished, his tone now softened but still tinged with annoyance.

Gavlo cautiously stepped into the room, deftly sidestepping the softly glowing glyph on the ground, his eyes scanning the surroundings with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. Once a library or perhaps a study, the room was now a shadow of its former self. Bookshelves lined the walls, their once-ornate designs now faded and worn with age. Piles of books lay scattered across a reading table positioned in the center of the room, alongside the scrolls and crystal ball belonging to the elf. The air was heavy with the musty scent of old paper, a testament to the passage of time and neglect. One door behind the elf, and a another to the left of the entrance seems to be the only other features in this room.

After a tense few minutes, Gavlo leaned in closer to the crystal, his keen eyes recognizing the familiar sights of Waterdeep and the figure of Laeral Silverhand within its depths. The elf's lips moved in silent murmurs, her words barely audible as she spoke mostly to herself. "Laeral is done for. If she flees Waterdeep, maybe she will live," she muttered, her gaze fixed on the swirling images within the crystal.

Suddenly, her attention shifted to the newcomers, her eyes narrowing slightly as she regarded them with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. "Well, what do we have here?" she remarked, her tone laced with a hint of amusement. "Quite an eclectic collection of troublemakers, eh?"

To which Gavlo answers "Were you surveying waterdeep?" "Yes, It took me a while to get there whrought scrying alone, but the bustling metropolis is a nice setting to write a novel about" says the elf.
"But thats another conversation, who are you and what are you doing here?"

"We've come here to investigate the weird light in the area, have you noticed that?" Gavlo inquired, breaking the tense silence.

"No? There were some weird visitors to the Stone Tooth a few hundred years ago, but nothing to worry about," the elf lady responded with a hint of indifference.

"Well, we also wanted to research this place over the ancient fortress of the dwarfs that used to live here. Do you know something about it, miss...?" Sersh trailed off.

"Idalla, and yes, my current predicament is related to that," she explained with a mixture of resignation and frustration. "My friend Arundil here decided to summon and bind me here to 'protect' this place after his clan got exterminated, but I'm not much of a fan of doing things against my will."

"So I didn't, I got rid of Arundil. But unfortunately I'm bound to the room, but with this scrying Orb I was able to keep myself entertained for a while, although it took quite some time to get to Waterdeep," Idalla revealed, a glimmer of defiance in her eyes as she recounted her plight.

Zarragon cautiously entered the room, sidestepping the glyph as he spoke, "Wait, but that makes you more than five centuries old, aren't Eladrin?". "What of it? I have my ways" aswered Idalla.

"But regardless of tall tales, you raucous bunch seem martially adept," Idalla remarked, her voice tinged with amusement. "So I would like to propose you a deal. There is a dragon beneath us, she is called Shadowscale, Darkscale, Nightwing, or something. Younger dragons don't have a lot of creativity for naming themselves." She conjured a parchment and spread ink across it with her prestidigitation, drawing a metal flask covered in primordial runes. "This one is in her hoard, I want it. I offer you information about the creature, as well as a reward sponsored by Arundil's stash. He isn't gonna need it anymore, Right, Arundil?" She gestured to the mummy, who grumbled in response.

"We want some time to ponder over the proposal," Gavlo says, his brow furrowed in thought.

"Suit yourself," answers Idalla, her expression unreadable.

The party nods, exchanging glances before turning to leave, pulling the room's door shut behind them.

As they retreat down the corridor, Vega breaks the silence. "Do you think she's lying?"

Sersh shrugs, his eyes darting between his companions. "Either she's a very good liar or she's telling the truth."

"Either way, we better get some rest and patch ourselves up before talking to her again. I'm running on fumes," adds Zarragon, rubbing his temples wearily.

The party reaches a consensus and heads back to the rug room, seeking respite and sustenance after their taxing encounter.
