### Log
Session starts with the group rolling initiative in the massive mushroom filled cavern, as the adventurers are surprised by the antropomorphic insect `Umber Hulk` who sprouted from the ground and proceeded to distribute blows to Sersh and Zarragon, missing sersh's heavy armor with its claws, but bitting hard into zarragon's flesh.
As the creature fixated its gaze upon the group, each member of the party felt the weight of the Umberhulk's gaze pressing down upon their minds, like tendrils of shadow creeping insidiously through their thoughts.
A cacophony of confusion erupted within their minds, twisting their perceptions and distorting their sense of reality. Vega stumbled blindly, his feet carrying him in aimless spirals through the gloom, his mind ensnared within the Umberhulk's labyrinthine gaze. Gavlo and Zarragon stood frozen in place, their eyes glazed over with a haunted bewilderment as they grappled with the maddening whispers that echoed within their skulls. They reached out futilely, grasping at specters of clarity that danced just beyond their grasp, like phantoms in the mist. Sersh Orc blood triggered a primal instinct stirred within, a savage fury unleashed by the creature's insidious influence. He turned his weapons against the nearest silhouetes with frenzied abandon, his blows striking out blindly as they sought to crush bone, unaware of friend or foe in the maelstrom of confusion.
The creature proceeded to attack sersh again, causing a gashing wound with his bettle-like claws, and then swiped at zarragon before bitting him again. 

Gavlo was the first to break out of the creatures mental grasp by avoiding his gaze, he proceeds to shout "Dont look at it!", before vaulting into the midst of the towering mushrooms, seeking cover from the creature's malevolent gaze and then conjuring the ever potent flamming sphere.  His arcane assault started by burning the creature's many antennae distributed across the carapace. Sersh followed suit by swinging blind with his newly acquired durgeddin-made warhammer, striking a lucky blow that tore a gaping hole in the creature's chitinous carapace. Zarragon tried to blindly swing at the creature, but was unable to hit the joints where his rapier would've been able to gain pruchase. Vega tried to steel his resolve, but once again found his counsciousness slipping away.
The creature, being burned by the sphere, took another swipe to Zarragon, dropping him to the ground from the lancing pain, and then dug himself into the ground. Disappearing from view, but not from Gavlo's newly acquired tremmorsense, as his boots tell him where the creature moves to, Gavlo cries: "Beneath you Vega! Move your ass out of there!", hearing this Sersh move into position to intercept the creature. Vega escapes his daze long enought to move into formation and to acquire the divine intervention, bringing about the Twilight Sanctuary, as Gavlo casts a spell to bring Zarragon back from the brink of death. But the creature tunnels into the midst of their formation, and proceeds to slash at the tree of them. Missing most but hitting zarragon before he is able to stand back up, protected by the twilight divine magic, he is able to withstand the blow, get back on his feet and attack while keeping his eyes averted from the creature's. Sersh comes in just in time to crack the carapace with his warhammer empowered by a `divine smite`, splaying the innards of the insect-like behemot on the cave floor. 

The tired party proceeds to recover their breath while Vega performs the ritual for `Prayer of healing`, alleviating his companions wounds. 
Vega asks: "Gavlo, what the heck is this thing?"
Gavlo thinks for a bit, and goes throught his notebooks: "It's an Umberhulk, they usually keep to the underdark, people usually don't remeber encounters with them, I guess its because of theses weird eyes", he then proceeds to cut the eyes of and store them on his haversack.
Zarragon investigates the stone door on the end of the hall, and manages to open it with the key acquired in the prison cell on the Sinkhole. After a brief discussion he and Sersh give up on the idea of taking the door along to sell it somewhere, as it seems like a magically fortified door.
THe party climbs a long flight of stairs which end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. The floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the walls are dressed with polished marble. Large doors of iron-bound oak exit to the northwest and northeast. Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand by the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed dwarf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and shields. The center statue is armed with two axes. The ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor.

The party notices tracks in the dusty floor leading into the east door, but after some investigation, Sersh tries to open the visible door with his darkenss coated `Mage Hand`, triggering the traps and causing the statues to drop their axes into the floor. 
Intrigued by the tracks, Gavlo helps Zarragon find a secret entrace, a hidden door leading into another flight of stairs. Sersh takes the front and starts heading toward the door on the top of the stairs, but triggers an alarm as a `Magic Mouth` starts shouting "Alarm! Alaram! Intruders!" in olden Dwarvish.
The party braces themselfs for another round of combat, but as Vega kicks the door open, they see a small army of kobolds taking cover behind wooden staked pallisades, at the forefront a big squatting lizardfolk in heavy armor. Behind them an enormous hall lined with ten great pillars, carved into the forms of giants and dragons, that support the vaulted ceiling high above. Guttering orange torches set in sconces along the walls illuminate the room, and a mighty throne sits on a dais at the opposite end. The walls were once covered with tile mosaics, but they have been smashed and defiled by graffiti. Tiny fragments of tile litter the floor. The party is able to see three other exits, and many large, decorated, vases stacked against the walls. A small fire smolders on the floor before the dais, where six sleeping pallets lie empty, surrounded by packs and supplies. 


A harsh voice pierced the air from behind the lines of Kobold's formation: "Go back the way you came! This is the only warning you'll get!" Gavlo, undeterred by the hostility, dashed forward with an attempt to bridge the gap with diplomacy. "Greetings, friends! Impressive setup you have here! Well, except for that pesky umberhulk, but fear not, we've dealt with it on your behalf."

A winged kobold emerged from among his companions, extending a tentative welcome. "Welcome then, friend, and thank you for dispatching the creature. But pray tell, what brings you and your companions to these remote parts? It's quite an unexpected encounter," he inquired.

Gavlo, always quick-witted, responded with a casual demeanor, "Ah, just a routine investigation. Noticed some peculiarities with the mountain's illumination, so naturally, we had to explore. Oh, and yes, we did fix the lighting issue—no need for thanks!"

The kobold nodded in understanding, though his hospitality came with a condition. "Understandable. However, our hospitality requires a small gesture of trust—your weapons, if you please."

Gavlo glanced at his companions, sensing their reluctance to part with their arms. "We appreciate the offer, but we'll have to decline. We're not ones to trust so easily. Instead, may we have permission to explore the palace?"

The winged kobold hesitated, initially proposing a fee for their entry. However, a whispered conversation among his kin led to a change of heart. "Forget the fee. Your service in securing the area is payment enough. But do tread carefully—there are threats abound. The room to your left houses a nest of undead, while the one to your right contains some rather irritable furniture."

"Furniture?" Gavlo's curiosity piqued.

"Yes, strange magical happenings indeed. Take heed and steer clear of our occupied chambers. And pray tell, have you encountered a black dragon outside?" inquired the winged kobold, only to be interrupted by Vega's fabricated response.

"Yes, indeed. It was circling the peak," Vega lied smoothly, his words laced with deceit.

The kobolds exchanged doubtful glances, prompting a warning from a lizardfolk among them. "Be cautious. She's not in her right mind."

"Urujam, enough!" snapped one of the winged kobolds, silencing the interjection. "Apologies," Urujam muttered sheepishly.

"So, can you remove those stakes that are barricading the doors or do you want us to do it ourselfs?" asked Sersh.

"We will move them, and place them again after you. We need also to re-arm those traps you've gone throught, to prevent any unwanted guests. Namely, those trogs outside".

Two kobolds then went past the party into the stairwell to lock the door tat the party left open, and some four of them came in to unbarricade the northmost door, leaving the path open to the party.

"Well, we wish you luck," said the winged kobold. "Thanks," Replied Gavlo.

With Sersh in front, the party enters a room that at first glance, looks like it was once a shrine to the gods of the dwarves. The walls are carved with their dour images, and a low stone altar stands at the western end of the room. Stone benches have been smashed and thrown askew, and the icons of the gods have been defaced.

Atop the altar, arms folded over his chest, lies the ancient corpse of a dwarf warrior in plate armor. Bones lie heaped around the altar's base, and at its foot crouches the desiccated body of an orc in studded leather. Some of the bones at the foot of the altar stir and form into a towering skeleton clutching a greatclub. Another mummified corpse stands and a third corpse remains motionless until a ghostly specter form on top of it. The dead orc warriors look up at the Sersh and grins evilly, their hatred palpable in the flickering green flames dancing within their hollow sockets.

Without hesitation, Sersh launches himself at the spectral entity, his warhammer wreathed in verdant flames that flicker and dance with divine power. With a resounding strike, fueled by righteous fury, he delivers a blow that strikes true, nearly dissipating the ethereal apparition in a single, devastating blow. Yet, in retaliation, the specter claws at Sersh with an otherworldly force, draining him of vitality and leaving behind an eerie pallor upon his flesh.

Meanwhile, Vega strides into the chamber, his voice resonating with celestial authority as he invokes a divine censure upon the undead horrors. "Begone, foul abominations!" he proclaims, his eyes aglow with radiant power as he channels his celestial heritage. His celestial aura overwhelms the spectral light within the undead's eyes, banishing the darkness that had consumed them. Across the room, the skeletal ogre cowers, while the mummified revenant lashes out at Vega with its decaying appendages, leaving streaks of grime upon his shield.

With swift precision, Zarragon joins the fray, flanking the revenant alongside Vega. Their combined assault proves relentless, as Zarragon's blade finds purchase while Vega's warhammer delivers resounding blows. Meanwhile, Gavlo, ever resourceful, dips his bolts in holy water before unleashing a barrage of blessed projectiles upon the undead horde. Sersh, circling the skirmish, engages the remaining skeletal abomination, his magical warhammer reducing it to a pile of splintered bones with each crushing blow.

Despite the revenant's futile attempts to vocalize its hatred, Vega remains steadfast, his determination unwavering. With a final, decisive stroke, Zarragon severs the revenant's head, while Gavlo's well-aimed shot pierces the ogre skeleton's eye socket, engulfing it in flames as the shattered bones collapse upon the floor in a heap of smoldering ruin.
