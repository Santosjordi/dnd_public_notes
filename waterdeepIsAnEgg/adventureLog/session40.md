### Log
Session starts with the group rolling initiative in the massive mushroom filled cavern, as the adventurers are surprised by the antropomorphic insect `Umber Hulk` who sprouted from the ground and proceeded to distribute blows to Sersh and Zarragon, missing sersh's heavy armor with its claws, but bitting hard into zarragon's flesh.
As the creature fixated its gaze upon the group, each member of the party felt the weight of the Umberhulk's gaze pressing down upon their minds, like tendrils of shadow creeping insidiously through their thoughts.
A cacophony of confusion erupted within their minds, twisting their perceptions and distorting their sense of reality. Vega stumbled blindly, his feet carrying him in aimless spirals through the gloom, his mind ensnared within the Umberhulk's labyrinthine gaze. Gavlo and Zarragon stood frozen in place, their eyes glazed over with a haunted bewilderment as they grappled with the maddening whispers that echoed within their skulls. They reached out futilely, grasping at specters of clarity that danced just beyond their grasp, like phantoms in the mist. Sersh Orc blood triggered a primal instinct stirred within, a savage fury unleashed by the creature's insidious influence. He turned his weapons against the nearest silhouetes with frenzied abandon, his blows striking out blindly as they sought to crush bone, unaware of friend or foe in the maelstrom of confusion.
The creature proceeded to attack sersh again, causing a gashing wound with his bettle-like claws, and then swiped at zarragon before bitting him again. 

Gavlo was the first to break out of the creatures mental grasp, by avoiding his gaze and shouting "Dont look at it!", he jumped into the midst of the large mushrooms, getting cover from the creatures gaze and then conjuring the ever potent flamming sphere.  His arcane assault stated by burning the creature's many antennae distributed across the carapace. Sersh followed suit by swinging blind with his newly acquired durgeddin-made warhammer and managed to hit a lucky strike, making a gap into hte creature's chitinous carapace. Zarragon tried to blindly swing at the creature, but was unable to hit the joints where his rapier would've been able to gain pruchase. Vega tried to steel his resolve, but once again found his counsciousness slipping away.
The creature, being burned by the sphere, took another swipe to Zarragon, dropping him to the ground from the lancing pain, and then dug himself into the ground. Disappearing from view, but not from Gavlo's newly acquired tremmorsense, as his boots tell him where the creature moves to, Gavlo cries: "Beneath you Vega! Move your ass out of there!", hearing this Sersh move into position to intercept the creature. Vega escapes his daze long enought to move into formation and to acquire the divine intervention, bringing about the Twilight Sanctuary, as Gavlo casts a spell to bring Zarragon back from the brink of death. But the creature tunnels into the midst of their formation, and proceeds to slash at the tree of them. Missing most but hitting zarragon before he is able to stand back up, protected by the twilight divine magic, he is able to withstand the blow, get back on his feet and attack while keeping his eyes averted from the creature's. Sersh comes in just in time to crack the carapace with his warhammer empowered by a divine smite, splaying the innards of the insect-like behemot on the cave floor. The tired party proceeds to recover their breath while Vega performs the ritual for `Prayer of healing`, alleviating his companions wounds. Zarragon investigates the stone door on the end of the hall, and manages to open it with the key acquired in the prison cell on the Sinkhole. After a brief discussion he and Sersh give up on the idea of taking the door along to sell it somewhere, as it seems like a magically fortified door.
THe party climbs a long flight of stairs which end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. The floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the walls are dressed with polished marble. Large doors of iron-bound oak exit to the northwest and northeast. Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand by the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed dwarf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and shields. The center statue is armed with two axes. The ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor.

The party notices tracks in the dusty floor leading into the east door, but after some investigation, Sersh tries to open the visible door with his darkenss coated `Mage Hand`, triggering the traps and causing the statues to drop their axes into the floor.
