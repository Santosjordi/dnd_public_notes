### Log

The session begins at the ominous Black Lake, deep within Khundrukar, the last bastion of Durgeddin's clan. The party enters the expansive cavern, their inhuman eyes adapted to the darkness. They see a small islet in the center of the lake, glittering with precious metals and long-forgotten artifacts. As they traverse the small bridge crossing the river, it collapses, and the dragoness Nightscale ambushes them with a jet of acid, burning Sersh and Gavlo.

Gavlo invokes a spell of invisibility and dashes toward the islet, while Sersh readies a spell for the dragoness's next emergence. Zarragon manages to pull Vega from the ledge, only for the dragon to unleash another acidic assault, rendering both unconscious from the searing pain. Sersh's spell strikes the dragon, but to no noticeable effect. He then rushes to his friends' aid, imbuing them with the Paladin's holy light, reviving them.

Revived by Sersh's magic, Zarragon and Vega distance themselves to avoid being taken out by a single attack. Vega calls upon Helm, "Bring the light of the Lord of Twilight!" A beam of radiant moonlight illuminates the cave. Zarragon positions himself a few meters away, ready to blast the dragoness when she surfaces. The dragon surprises them by emerging from a different location, drenching Vega in acid once more. As Vega falls, Zarragon's eldritch energy hits the water, missing the dragon.

Sersh's spell strikes true, targeting Nightscale's mind, leaving her confused and lethargic. She submerges, and Gavlo uses his ring of spell storing to conjure a massive spectral hand, which grapples the dragon. Nightscale bites and lacerates the arcane construct before freeing herself.

Gavlo, undeterred, rushes over the narrow ledges to the islet. Amidst the coins and other valuables, his attention is drawn to an ornate box and an obsidian-colored glaive. Believing the box contains the item they seek, Gavlo opens it and finds the Iron Flask. Desperate, he decides to gamble on the fairy tales of genies in lamps and opens the flask.

Sand pours out, forming a large humanoid in ornate metal clothing. "I am Lithorak, firstborn of Tet Balat! Who are you, and where are the dwarfs?" asks the figure. "I am Gavlo, but before we discuss the dwarfs, could you help us with the dragon?" Gavlo pleads. Lithorak agrees, promising to repay Gavlo by aiding his friends. Chanting in a grave language, Lithorak summons a stalactite elemental from the cavern walls.

Hovering above the lake's surface, Lithorak calls out, "Come, little dragon, and meet your better! Bow before me as a slave, and I shall grant you mercy!" Enraged, Nightscale surfaces beneath Lithorak, only to be slammed by the elemental's stone arm. Lithorak conjures a phantasmal apparition of a larger dragon, gripping Nightscale's heart with fear.

Desperate, the dragoness uses her breath weapon on Sersh. Prepared, he dives away and casts his elemental absorption spell, mitigating most of the damage.

From there, it takes but a few more blows before the party overcomes the dragoness. In a moment, the lustrous black corpse of Nightscale floats on the surface of the lake, her acidic blood mixing with the water and raising a cloud of noxious gas.

"Now, where are the dwarfs?" demands Lithorak, his voice thick with a heavy accent.

"They are gone, dead some four centuries ago, it seems," answers Gavlo.

"Damn mortals, can't even have a proper revenge here," Lithorak grumbles. He then turns his gaze to Gavlo. "You, little one, do you want to be my slave?"

"Thanks, but I'll pass," Gavlo replies quickly.

Lithorak looks around, extending the offer to the others, who promptly shake their heads in a firm refusal. "Your. Loss," he says, sounding almost disappointed. "I'll need to check the dwarven fate for myself."

With that, Lithorak and the elemental meld with the wall, disappearing from sight.

The party, left alone in the aftermath, takes a moment to catch their breath. The cavern is eerily silent save for the constant roar of the waterfall. Vega, still feeling the sting of the acid, looks at his companions.

"We did it," he says, almost in disbelief.

"Let's gather what we can from the dragon's hoard and get out of here," Zarragon suggests. "We've had enough excitement for one day."

They make their way to the islet, where the dragon's treasures glitter invitingly. As they sift through the hoard, they find not only precious metals and artifacts but also several items of significant power. Each party member takes their share, feeling a mix of exhaustion and triumph.

Zarragon took his time meticulously harvesting scales and teeth from Nightscale's corpse, ensuring they gathered the most valuable materials. The gleaming scales and sharp fangs spoke of the dragon's power, now a testament to their victory.

Using part of the dragon's flesh as toll for the Roper, the party safely climbed back to the Foundry level. Many kobolds awaited them on the edge of the waterfall, their expressions a mix of relief and melancholy. Nightscale may have been a threat, but she was also a part of their clan's history.

"It's done," Sersh announces solemnly. "The dragon is no more."

"Then let us put up a small celebration, for a weight has been lifted from us today," says the Winged Kobold leader. The kobolds gather, and a simple feast of fish soup is shared. The party recounts their harrowing tale to the little dragon-dog people, who listen with wide eyes and eager hearts, fascinated by the heroes' bravery and skill.

Meanwhile, Vega excuses himself from the festivities and heads towards Idalla's room. Before he can knock, the door swings open, revealing Arundil's mummified form making its way to the master's desk.

"I see that you succeeded in the first part of the quest," Idalla remarks from her desk, hands clasped together.

"Yes," Vega replies, relieved to see the mummy again. "We faced Nightscale and retrieved the Iron Flask."


Idalla nods approvingly. "Good. Now, you must prepare for the next part. Give me the bottle, and leave the premises for a minute." Vega complies, exiting the room as requested. Half an hour later, he returns to find Arundil's mummified form standing before him, holding the Iron Flask and a booklet.

"You know the rest of the deal," Idalla says from her desk, the mummy stands offering the items to Vega. "Take Arundil's blueprints as your reward, and deliver the flask to Waterdeep."

"Yes, I remember my end of the bargain," Vega replies, taking the Flask and the blueprints with a sense of solemnity.

"Good. Now leave," Idalla commands.

Vega rejoins his companions in the Kobolds' common room. "I'm done."

"Great," Zarragon responds. "Me and Sersh managed to convince the Kobolds to let us use the forge. We'll repair that chain shirt we found, and then we're ready to go as well."

With the repairs underway and the next steps of their quest laid out, the party prepares for their journey to Waterdeep, their resolve strengthened by their recent triumph over Nightscale and the promise of what lies ahead.
