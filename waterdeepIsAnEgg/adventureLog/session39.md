### Log
The session commenced at the 'Sinkhole' level of Durgedin's fortress ruins. The party had recently ventured into an old storage room, with the door yielding grudgingly to reveal a low chamber crafted from dressed stone. Within, they discovered a plethora of decaying provisions—barrels of salted meat turned rancid, sacks of flour or grain cloaked in russet-colored mold, and tuns of cider transformed into vinegar. Two open archways on the east wall led to similar rooms, with two more dimly visible beyond. The floor beyond the first archway gleamed wetly.

As they proceeded into the next room, a swarm of bats descended upon the group, but the seasoned adventurers dispatched them swiftly. Gavlo set to work skinning three giant bats while the others scoured the area for valuables. Zarragon, ever observant, spotted a cache that had weathered the passage of time: six vials nestled within a small metallic box, although three had lost their luster due to faulty sealing on the cork. Zarragon distributed the vials to ensure each member possessed at least one potion.

Leaving the moldy storeroom behind, they explored the adjacent chamber in the waterfall cave, only to find it dry and devoid of interest. Progressing onto the river sidewalk, they traversed a bridge into a cavernous corridor bristling with stalactites. Despite their caution, they were ambushed by Piercers—stone-like monstrosities narrowly missing their descent onto the adventurers. Unfortunately, Vega sustained a heavy blow to his shoulder from one of the creatures.

Their attempts to dispatch the creatures were thwarted as the Piercers plummeted into the river, eluding retaliation. Taking the initiative, Sersh led the party deeper into the complex, ascending a flight of stairs with Vega, Zarragon, and Gavlo close behind. Atop the stairs, tendrils erupted from a stalagmite across the river, ensnaring Vega and Zarragon while narrowly missing Sersh and Gavlo. Despite Vega's struggle, he and Zarragon were dragged towards the stalagmite, whereupon Zarragon valiantly freed himself, albeit not without injury.

As Zarragon tumbled away, a menacing eye and monstrous jaw emerged from the stalagmite, biting at his arm before turning its attention to Vega, who was pulled into the river. Reacting swiftly, Gavlo conjured a flaming sphere, launching an arcane assault on the creature, while Sersh's necromantic magic proved ineffective against its rocky exterior. Despite being bitten, Zarragon managed to inflict some damage before succumbing to unconsciousness from his grievous wound. Vega, freed from the tendril, struggled against the river's current, sustaining further injury.

With the creature now partially cooked by Gavlo's onslaught, he attempted to aid Zarragon with his crossbow, albeit unsuccessfully. Witnessing Vega's peril, Sersh dashed to his aid, pulling him from the water. Vega proceeded to invoked divine magic to vanquish the abomination. Spectral bells materialized, causing the creature to suffer necrosis and perish swiftly. Vega then employed his divine abilities to heal Zarragon's wounds, who awoke in distress.

While Zarragon and the others investigated the dwarven-made room on the opposite side of the cavern, Gavlo examined the roper's stony gizzard, discovering a ring of spell storing and a collection of gemstones, which he pocketed for safekeeping. Meanwhile, the rest of the party discovered a sturdy iron door in the north wall of the cavern, leading to a short passageway with three small iron doors. With the help of a key found among the rubble, Zarragon unlocked the last door, revealing the remains of a dwarf in corroded full plate armor, alongside a small purse containing platinum coins and another key.

The party collectively agreed to rest and recuperate in this chamber before proceeding further in search of an exit. Vega performed a ritual, conjuring Leomund's Tiny Hut to provide a secure and comfortable resting place. The following day, fully rejuvenated, they resumed their exploration of the glitterhame, but their progress was interrupted as Gavlo sensed an approaching presence through his Boots of Grounding. Before he could warn his companions, a massive insectoid emerged from the loose soil.
