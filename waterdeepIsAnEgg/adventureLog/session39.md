### Log
Session starts at the `Sinkhole` level of the Durgedin's fortress ruins. 
The party last entered an Old storage room, the door giving way grudgingly, revealing a low chamber of dressed stone. 
The chamber was filled with what appears to be rotten foodâ€”barrels of salted meat gone bad, sacks of flour or grain covered in russet-colored mold, tuns of cider turned to vinegar.
Two open archways in the east wall lead to a similar room, and two more openings are dimly visible beyond. The floor just past the first archway gleams wetly. 
After entering the next room, the group is attacked by a swarm of bats, that the seasoned adventurers made quick work of.
Gavlo took to work on removing the hides from 3 giant bats while everyone else went around looking for anything worthwhile. 
Zarragon, keen as ever, managed to spot a cache that withstood the passage of time, 6 vials in a small metalic box, healing potions, 3 o which lost their luster due to some bad sealing on the cork. 
Zarragon chose to distribute the vials, so everyone has at least one potion.
The party left the moldy store room, investigating the next room on the waterfall cave, only to find it dry and empty. They proceeded to move on to the river sidewal, crossing a bridge into a cavernous corridor, filled with stalactites.
