### Log
Session starts at the `Sinkhole` level of the Durgedin's fortress ruins. 
The party last entered an Old storage room, the door giving way grudgingly, revealing a low chamber of dressed stone. 
The chamber was filled with what appears to be rotten foodâ€”barrels of salted meat gone bad, sacks of flour or grain covered in russet-colored mold, tuns of cider turned to vinegar.
Two open archways in the east wall lead to a similar room, and two more openings are dimly visible beyond. The floor just past the first archway gleams wetly. 
After entering the next room, the group is attacked by a swarm of bats, that the seasoned adventurers made quick work of.
Gavlo took to work on removing the hides from 3 giant bats while everyone else went around looking for anything worthwhile. 
Zarragon, keen as ever, managed to spot a cache that withstood the passage of time, 6 vials in a small metalic box, healing potions, 3 o which lost their luster due to some bad sealing on the cork. 
Zarragon chose to distribute the vials, so everyone has at least one potion.
The party left the moldy store room, investigating the next room on the waterfall cave, only to find it dry and empty. They proceeded to move on to the river sidewalk, crossing a bridge into a cavernous corridor, filled with stalactites.
Carefully moving as close as possible to the wall, they still got attacked by Piercers, the stone like monstrosities missing the drop on the adventurers by a a few centimeters, unfortunately Vega still took a heavy blow to his shoulder as the creture dropped.
They tried to kill the creatures, and managed to inflict some wounds, but unfortunately they dropped into the river, escaping the retribution of their prey.
Sersh takes the inititave and moves deeper into the complex, over a flight of stairs, after him Vega, Zarragon and Gavlo followed. On the top of the stairs, tendrils shot from a stalagmite on the other side of the river, grabbing Vega and Zarragon, but missing Sersh and Gavlo. Vega tries to overpower the tendril but fails, as the tendril pull them towards the Stalagmite, Zarragon jumps over the river and with a sommersault, gets rid of the tendril, as he does so, a red eye and a monstruous jaw open on th stalagmite, it takes advantage of Zarragon proximity to bite at his arm, removing a morsel of flesh. Vega gets dragged into the river, still trying to get freed from his restrains.
Gavlo, taken by surprise moves back into the stais before conjuring a flamming sphere an begins his arcane assault over the monstrosity, Sersh tries to do so aswell, but his necromantic magic doesn't seem to be able to bypass the rocky exterior of the creature.
After being bitten, Zarragon manages to take a series of quick stabs, before being bitten again, this time being brought to unscounsciouness as the wound bleeds profusely. Vega manages to free himself from the tendril, but gets dragged on the fast flowing river, hitting the rocky protusions on the margins. Gavlo's Arcane assault starts to cook the creature, making the most of the situation, he still tries to fire his crossbow, but the bolt richochets of. Seeing Vega being carried by the river flow, Sersh runs to help his armored friend and manages to grab him before he vanishes into the underground, afeter being brought out of the water Vega invokes his divine magic to punish the abominations, 2 spectral bells materialize in from of him, their sound only audible to the creature, cause it to rapidly sufer necrosis, ending its life.
