### Log

The session begins after a week of downtime. Sersh and Zarragon spent their time searching for ways to spend their hard-earned gold. Gavlo, on the other hand, indulged in a gambling spree and, through a lucky streak, managed to double his money in just a week, much to the dismay of the Mirabarran dwarves. Sersh found a skilled weaver to mend the Rug of Smothering.

Vega, seeking solace, visited the shrine of Helm in Mirabar, known as the River Watchtower. There, he encountered Father Utravsky, an imposing, elderly cleric.

"I know every Helmite in the North of the Sword Coast, but I’m unfamiliar with you, lad," Father Utravsky remarked, his voice deep and commanding.

"M-my name is Vega, Father. I'm originally from Elturel," Vega stammered. "We... we came here on a contract, my friends and I, to excavate some ruins. We just returned from the Spine."

The old man began pouring tea into a large mug for the young cleric. "Pillaging old tombs isn’t exactly within our expected duties," he said, pointing to his own holy symbol. "Guarding them, perhaps. But I’m not here to chastise you; I’ve been to Maztica myself. Ignore the ramblings of an old man. Continue your tale."

"Well, Father, I came here seeking guidance. I failed in my duty to guard my wards. When the battle fervor rose within me, I lost control. Instead of ensuring their safety, I threw myself at the enemy. It was only after the battle that I realized the cost," Vega confessed, his voice heavy with guilt.

Father Utravsky nodded solemnly. "Many would advise otherwise, but sometimes a preemptive strike is the best defense. Unfortunately, in your case, it was a costly mistake."

Vega continued, recounting the harrowing details of their incursion into the Stone Tooth. He spoke of arriving at the fortress, being shunned by the orcs residing inside, sneaking in through the natural chimney, and slaughtering most of the tribe. He described how a few female orcs, clutching their infants, managed to escape, cutting the rope bridge behind them while the party finished off the remaining warriors.

"And now, I feel I’ve strayed from the gods’ teachings. I seek to repent," Vega admitted, his voice faltering.

Father Utravsky stood in silence, a twitch in his left eye, his knuckles white as he gripped the wooden tea mug. After a long, heavy pause, he sighed deeply. "Your greed will be your downfall, just as it was for the Companions in Maztica. But it is not my place to judge you, only to offer guidance. Your heart is plagued by greed and the lust for battle. The desire for more, to the point of greed, often stems from the feeling of not having enough. A person can have all the money in the world and still pursue more. A person can be generously loved by a friend, yet feel the need to control that person to ensure their affection. To rid yourself of this greed, you must realize that you have enough—make do with what you have. I can suggest you a penitence, let a year go by with only what you have. As for the battlelust, I cannot guide you, for I suffer from the same condition. I will seek out Hlam in Waterdeep in a few weeks. I advise you to do the same."

"Thank you, Father. I will impose the penitence on myself" Vega vowed, before bidding farewell to the cleric and rejoining his friends.

Sersh felt the cold press of a blade against his throat. "I wouldn't do that if I were you," he snarled.

"Oh, but it’s so much fun!" came a playful, feminine voice, just before Sersh felt a soft kiss on his cheek.

"Hi, Sershy! Grumpy as ever, I see! What have you been up to?" asked Thalia, a half-elf and Sersh’s childhood friend from the streets while sheating a dagger.

Sersh sighed, his tension easing slightly as he recognized the familiar voice. "I definitely wasn’t expecting to see you here. And what’s with the dagger to my throat, Thalia?"

"Sheesh, no need to get so worked up," Thalia replied with a mischievous grin. "Buy me a drink, and let’s catch up. I’m recruiting, and I think you might be interested."

"... Fine," Sersh muttered, unable to stay mad at his old friend.

A few minutes later, they were seated in a dimly lit tavern in one of Mirabar’s shadier districts. The room buzzed with low conversation, the perfect backdrop for their reunion.

"So, Bran joined the Watch, Lyra’s doing theater now—she even snagged herself some filthy rich Gundwynd guy," Thalia said, catching Sersh up on their old gang. "I haven’t heard from Sunshine in a while. What about you? I see you’ve got some new friends."

"Yeah," Sersh nodded. "We’ve been taking some contracts together, all above board now. The last one went sideways, but we managed to come away with some pretty interesting artifacts."

"Yeah, I heard about the commotion over 'Durgeddin the Black’s last fortress' and the supposed incredible wealth within," Thalia said, a smirk playing on her lips. "Sounded like a trap, to be honest, but judging by the look of you, it seems you guys walked away with some goodies, didn’t you?"

"Something like that," Sersh replied. "But we let our contractor die along the way, so the reparations are going to hurt."

"Boo hoo, so you’re rich, just not filthy rich?" Thalia teased. "Anyway, how about you lend me 30 dragons, and I’ll let you in on a sweet gig?"

Sersh frowned but eventually pulled some coins from his well-kept pouch.

"Always dependable," Thalia grinned, pocketing the money. "Listen, do you remember the Kolat brothers? The ones with those strange towers in the Trades Ward that the Robes could never manage to tear down?"

"Yeah," Sersh nodded. "People said sneaking inside would turn you into glass. I didn’t believe it until I saw it myself."

"Well," Thalia continued, leaning in conspiratorially, "Laeral Silverhand just got ousted as the Open Lord in the last Shieldmeet. Guess who took over?"

"The Cassalanters?" Sersh guessed. "If anyone could buy off the Masked Lords to betray Lady Silverhand, it’d be them."

"Nope. Duhlark Kolat."

"Who?"

"One of the Kolat brothers. Supposed to be dead, but he came back a few years ago. But here’s the thing—and keep this to yourself—I’ve got it on good authority that the guy is just a guise for Manshoon, or one of Manshoon’s clones, if anyone can tell the difference."

"Wait, what the hell? How did you find that out?" Sersh asked, eyes narrowing.

"Not important right now," Thalia waved off his question. "What matters is that he’s offering hefty sums to any Zhent worth their salt, mostly to venture down into Undermountain. If you’re looking for money, the new Open Lord’s going to line your pockets if you come out of that dungeon alive."

"Well, that’s definitely interesting," Sersh admitted, thinking it over. "I’ve been wanting to get back to Waterdeep for a while now, but I’ve got a bit of a grudge with some of Xanathar’s goons."

"Oh, you mean Harko, right? Don’t worry about him," Thalia reassured him. "He messed up big time—crossed some nobles in Yartar, and the Lord’s Alliance got involved. Last I heard, some mercs delivered his head to the Castle Ward."

Sersh raised an eyebrow, remebering the painfull lumps on his legs and back from their last encounter. "Good riddance."

"Well, that's it from me. I'll get going to the Dale. See you next year in Waterdeep if you go there! It was good seeing you Sershy". "You too Thalia".

That evening, everyone gathered for dinner at the inn, eager to share their findings about the city. Sersh had struck gold with a street vendor, discovering a cache of magical arrows hidden among the ordinary ones. Zarragon, with Gavlo’s help, had procured a powerful potion, and the two of them rented a forge to put the finishing touches on the unfinished Durgeddin weapons.

"Well, folks," Gavlo began, "it’s not that I dislike the city—though, to be honest, I do—but that’s beside the point. We’re pretty much done here, and I’m not sure if I remembered to lock my doors when I left Waterdeep."

"Yeah, I’ve got some good leads there as well," Sersh added, nodding.

"I’m happy to tag along," Zarragon chimed in. "There are some friends in Waterdeep I’ve been longing to see." Vega echoed the sentiment.

"Let’s wrap things up with the Heartfurys and be on our way," Sersh suggested.

Gavlo sighed, clearly exasperated. "Can’t we just pretend we’re oblivious to this whole mess?"

"If you’re cool with only getting hired by criminals, sure," Sersh replied. "But if we want to keep our reputation intact, we need to own up to our screw-up and play by the rules."

Gavlo looks around the  table, looking for likeminded opinions, finding none, he gives up "Fine, lets get to the family and apologize, I guess".
