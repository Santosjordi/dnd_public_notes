### Log
"She's a devil," Sersh muttered, his tone grim. "I can smell the foul stench from Avernus. Those fairies are devils as well."

"What about the mummy?" inquired Zarragon.

"Undead, doesn’t seem disguised," Sersh replied.

"Well, that complicates things a bit," Vega said thoughtfully. "But the deal seems pretty straightforward."

"Are you actually considering it? It's a fiend, for crying out loud!" Sersh exclaimed.

"Yeah, but the reward is very tempting, and I don’t see how she can bamboozle us," Vega countered. "I'll take it if you guys don’t want to get involved."

Sersh, looking exasperated, added, "We're not rescuing you from Hell if this goes bad, alright?"

"Relax, everything will be fine," Vega assured.

After resting in Arundil's quarters and preparing themselves, the group returned to Idalla's room.

Vega took the forefront. "We're ready to take the deal."

"Great," Idalla responded with a radiant smile. "I just need you to sign this contract to ensure you don't double-cross me."

"I'm not signing anything," Sersh declared, receiving nods of agreement from Gavlo and Zarragon.

"Fine, I'll do it alone then," Vega said resolutely.

"Well, someone has business acumen at least. The rest of you, out," Idalla commanded.

As the others left, Vega found himself alone with the fiendish elf and the mummified dwarf. "Sign here. This contract is separate from the other one. Give it a read, but it only ensures a hefty price if you disclose anything I tell you to anyone," Idalla instructed.

Vega spent the next hour meticulously reading the contracts. "The quest is simple: take the flask from the dragon, bring it to me, and then deliver it to the person stated in the contract. You have a year. Fail, and you relinquish your soul to me."

Vega looked conflicted for a moment but then signed both accords. "Death is not within my plans."

"Good, I'll be waiting here," Idalla said with satisfaction.

Vega rejoined his companions, nodding to them. "Well, we just need to get rid of this dragoness now."

"From what I gathered, the kobolds wouldn’t be terribly upset," Gavlo noted. "She seems to be going mad, and it's taking a huge toll on the clan just to keep her fed."

"We can try to sound them out or sneak into the dragon’s cave, but I think they are guarding the entrance," Zarragon suggested.

"Better go prepared for a fight," Vega concluded.

The group approached the kobold area of Khundrukar, with Gavlo leading the way. He spoke in Draconic to one of the guarding kobolds, who promptly left and returned with Urujam the Lizardman and a winged kobold.

"Olopom says you have something to discuss. What is it?" The winged kobold asks.

"Well, when we came in here, we agreed to keep out of each other's way," Gavlo began. "But we figured out that one of the things we're looking for might be in your dragoness's hoard. We hope we can acquire the item from you."

The winged kobold looked thoroughly conflicted. He asked for a moment and left, returning with another winged kobold.

"We have a proposal, but it requires you to take a risk," said the kobold. "Nightscale hasn't been herself for a while. She's paranoid and reclusive, and we've had to work hard just to keep her fed as she refuses to leave the cave. She's a large burden on the clan as it is, but we've managed to secure the alliance of another dragon-kin, one who is more of an asset than a liability."

The kobold paused before continuing, "The deal is this: Drive Nightscale off, and you can keep whatever you can carry from the hoard. We will also give you these axes we found in the foundry." He gestured to Urujam, who opened a wooden box containing eleven axeheads of different sizes. "I'm pretty sure these are incomplete dwarven magic weapons. Most of them are too big for us, but they seem valuable."

"So, you want us to kill your dragon?" Gavlo asked.

"If that's the only way to drive her off, then yes. But we hope you'll find another way," the kobold replied.

The party convened, discussing the possibility of this being a trap, but ultimately decided to accept the kobolds' offer.

"Alright," said Urujam. "Follow."

The lizardman led the party through a few empty rooms in the fortress and through secret passageways until they arrived at a narrow corridor. From the right, they could hear the thundering noise of a waterfall and smell the stench of rotting Duergar corpses.

Urujam pointed to the corpses and to the end of the corridor. "Rock monster down there, on the ceiling. You throw the body, it eats it, it no bother you."

"Who are these Duergar?" Sersh asked.

"Robbers, came from below," Urujam explained, pointing to a chain ladder bolted to the ground at the edge of the cave, which dropped 200 feet into a lake.

"Great," Sersh sighed. "Let's get going."

One by one, the group descended the chain ladder, testing its structural integrity as they went. Despite the centuries of humidity, the ladder, a testament to Dwarven craftsmanship, held firm. Sersh carried the Duergar corpse, his muscles straining under the weight. At the foot of the ladder, the thunderous roar of the waterfall filled their ears. With a grimace, Sersh hurled the corpse into the river. It floated for a few meters before being seized by familiar tendrils from the Roper on the ceiling. Loud crunches echoed through the cavern, and viscera fell from above. The party remained on high alert, but after a tense minute, it seemed the monstrosity was sated with its overripe meal.

The waterfall cave opened up into a vast chamber adorned with a system of columns and equal measures of stalactites and stalagmites. A thunderous spray of water filled the space, pooling and flowing out to join a larger river to the north. The air was damp, and the roar of the waterfall was deafening. A broad ledge led north toward the river, then turned out of sight to the east. The muddy bank of the pool was disturbed by tracks of some kind.

A fast-moving underground river roared from east to west beneath a stone bridge. The bottom of the chain ladder rested near the south bank of the river. On the north side of the bridge, a ledge continued to the east. After a short distance, the ledge bent southward, and a second bridge spanned the river.

The party crossed the first bridge, noticing claw marks etched into the stone. As they traversed the second bridge, it gave way, nearly throwing Vega into the rushing water below. Zarragon managed to catch him just in time, pulling him back to safety. The dilapidated bridge led to another ledge that wound southeast along a vast underground lake, seemingly the source of the river. The cavern was immense; the lake's far shore was lost in shadow, and the echoes of water suggested a sizable cave.

Gavlo and Sersh, who were at the front, turned to help, but a large black, scaly head with curved horns emerged from the lake. Sersh and Gavlo glimpsed the creature before it unleashed a jet of corrosive bile. Gavlo threw himself to the ground, avoiding the full brunt of the spray but feeling the burn as the mist washed over him. Sersh, less agile, managed to conjure a spell. "Absorb Elements!" he cried, and a ward materialized before him, reducing the acid's corrosiveness but unable to completely neutralize the attack.

Adrenaline pumping, Sersh looked towards the source of the attack but saw only ripples in the lake as the dragon dove beneath the surface once more.
