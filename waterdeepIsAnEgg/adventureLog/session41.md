### Log
Session starts just as the dust settles, the party finishes of the last remaining undead, which crashes into the shrines floor in a dusty pile of bones and mummified flesh.
Zarragon's keen eye caught sight of suspiciously straight cracks, a hidden door concealed within the intricate base-reliefs, prompting the party to investigate further.
Venturing into the newly discovered corridor, the group encountered a series of doors lining each side, each one concealing a horde of undead skeletons lying in wait. With Sersh leading the charge as the stalwart bulwark of the party, the others swiftly dispatched the skeletal foes, sending their restless souls to eternal rest with practiced efficiency.
Their successes continued until they reached a locked door, where Gavlo, upon touching the handle, heard a chilling ghostly voice warning them to leave. Ignoring the ominous message, the party proceeded to pick the lock, eager to uncover the mysteries beyond. Meanwhile, Vega, blessed with sight in darkness, caught sight of a chamber at the end of the corridor, filled with a multitude of corpses. Before he could alert the others, Gavlo unwittingly triggered a trap within the newly unlocked room. Within the lavishly furnished chamber, adorned with opulent dÃ©cor and numerous bookshelves, Gavlo found himself ensnared by a massive, ornate rug that came to life, wrapping tightly around him in a suffocating grip. With books flying off the shelves and assaulting the party, Sersh and Zarragon sprang into action to rescue their trapped comrade.
As they battled against the animated books and struggled to free Gavlo, Zarragon found himself ensnared by the malevolent rug as soon as he was able to pull Gavlo out of it. With determination and teamwork, Sersh and Vega eventually managed to destroy the animated books, allowing them to join forces with the now freed Gavlo to tear the rug of smothering to shreds and liberate their bruised and battered companion, Zarragon.
With Zarragon and Gavlo now badly bruised, mostly from strikes meant for the rug, the party decided to barricade themselves in the room and recuperate for a while. They had a small meal from their dwindling rations. Gavlo woke up feverish, and Sersh offered to help him with the sickness by invoking the divine healing power of his oath.
The party then left the room, to find a multitude of undead seemingly getting up from the other end of the corridor, Vega prompted his companions "Follow me, lets clear this place up" and before they could reply he ran in the undead direction. The rest of the party followed suit, Gavlo's Boots tingling, telling him about others horrors in the still closed doors as they pass by.
