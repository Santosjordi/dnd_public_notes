### Log
The session starts at the frozen pastures north of Longsaddle.
The party, still reeling from their bizarre encounter with Usidore, makes their way back to Longsaddle, leaving the smoldering fields behind. As they enter the town, they notice a large group of armed elves arriving. At the head of the group is Laeral Silverhand, the former Open Lord of Waterdeep. She greets Lady Eleanor Harpell with warm familiarity, and it becomes clear to the party that the two women share a close bond.

Curious and eager for answers, the party requests an audience with Lady Eleanor. They nervously reveal the legendary artifact Usidore entrusted to them, and Lady Eleanor's expression shifts from curiosity to exasperation. She rubs her temples, sighing deeply before addressing them.

"Ah, Usidore," she begins, sounding both fond and frustrated. "He peers into the future, and what he sees troubles him deeply—calamities, destruction, endless suffering. To him, it's not just seeing the future; it's like feeling every sorrow and fear that could be. He believes it's his duty—or perhaps his curse—to guide us towards the paths where the most lives are spared. But understand, he doesn't see the whole picture, just glimpses, fragments... enough to keep him up at night, chasing down these visions. That's why he does things that seem random, disconnected, or downright insane."

Lady Eleanor pauses, her gaze softening as she continues, "To most, he's a mad wizard. But I know him better. Usidore isn't driven by madness, but by a desperate hope to prevent the worst from happening. Every action, no matter how strange, is his attempt to stitch together a future that's less bleak. So if he gave you such an invaluable artifact, it wasn't without reason. He must have seen something—something big. Use it wisely, for the challenges ahead will be as daunting as the artifact is powerful."

The party nods, the weight of her words settling in as they take their leave. They decide to stay in Longsaddle for another day, holing up in the local tavern. As they share drinks and mull over Lady Eleanor's warning, they overhear whispers about Laeral Silverhand stepping down as the Open Lord of Waterdeep and making her exodus back to Silverymoon. It seems change is in the air, and the ripples of fate are growing stronger.

Gavlo decided to buy some riding  horses to get to Triboard faster, and the party departed from the curious little town.
