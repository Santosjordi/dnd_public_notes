### Log
The session starts with the party travelling towards Triboar.
The party trudges down the muddy road, their horses' hooves sinking into the slush as the sky looms a grim, unbroken gray above them. It's early spring, but the persistent drizzle and thawing snow have turned the path into a miserable slog. They travel slowly, carefully picking their way along the road that seems more like a swamp with every step.

After several days of this grueling pace, they find their path blocked north of Triboar. Angular stakes jut out from the ground in a crude but effective barricade, and angry-looking men and dwarves man the watchposts. Beyond the blockade, the party spots a cluster of tents pitched haphazardly along the roadside, damp and sagging under the weight of the constant rain.

“Stop! The road is closed,” shouts an armored dwarf, stepping forward with his axe slung over one shoulder.

Vega reins in his horse, peering through the drizzle. “May I know why?” he asks, his voice calm but edged with impatience.

“No, you may not,” the dwarf replies, a smug grin stretching across his bearded face.

Sersh squints through the gloom and recognizes the dwarf: Gorazin Heganbor, a well-known mercenary from Neverwinter. As Sersh opens his mouth to warn Vega, he notices Vega’s expression darken, his posture stiffening with frustration.

“Well, if you’re not going to give a good reason to block me,” Vega snaps, his voice rising, “I see no other choice but to cut my path through you.”

Gorazin lets out a hearty laugh, his eyes glinting with amusement. “Ha! I like your spirit, lad. Well, me and the lads are bored out of our skulls here. How about this? We’ll spar—me and my brother against you and your friends. If you win, I’ll let you through and give you ten platinum. If you lose, you pay me ten plat and turn your tails back. What do you say?”

“Deal!” Vega agrees without hesitation, dismounting his horse before his companions can voice their protests.

Sersh steps forward, worry etched on his face. “Vega, these guys are mercenaries, and we can’t use magic in a martial spar,” he cautions, glancing at the growing audience of soldiers emerging from the tents, eager to watch the fight.

“Don’t worry, we can do this,” Vega says with a determined nod. “We’ll fight two-on-two!”

Kazadni, Gorazin’s equally burly brother, tosses quarterstaffs to Vega and Sersh. “You know the rules, right?” he asks, tightening his grip on his own weapon.

“Yes,” Sersh replies, his voice firm despite the unease twisting in his gut.

The battle begins, the mud slick and treacherous underfoot. Gorazin and Kazadni move with the practiced ease of seasoned fighters, their teamwork seamless as they cover each other’s backs. Zarragon and Gavlo stand off to the side, watching anxiously.

Vega and Sersh press their attack, trying to exploit any gaps in the brothers' defense, but without their magic, they struggle against the heavily armored dwarves. Blow after blow, they are slowly worn down. Vega fights valiantly, his strikes landing with the force of his warrior’s training, but it’s not enough. He’s the first to fall, refusing to yield until Gorazin lands a brutal strike to his face, sending him sprawling into the mud, unconscious.

The crowd of mercenaries roars in approval, their cheers echoing through the dreary morning as Sersh, bruised and battered, remains standing. His endurance impresses even the Heganbor brothers, but the relentless assault eventually takes its toll. Sersh collapses, his vision darkening as he succumbs to the pain.

“Call a medic,” Gorazin orders, his tone respectful now. He turns to Gavlo and Zarragon. “Come, join us for supper. We’ve got some explaining to do.”

As they sit in one of the soggy tents, Gorazin explains between mouthfuls of stew. “Triboar’s been hit by a plague. We’re here to keep the sick in and the healthy out. Can’t let you pass, as much as I’d love to. Orders from Lady Pride herself. But you can take a boat from the Surbrin River east of here, just cross the Horn Stream. That’ll get you to Yartar.”

Gavlo, still irritated, hands Gorazin a pouch of gold. “You could have told us that before the whole sparring bit,” he grumbles.

Gorazin grins, that same infuriating smile stretching across his face. “Aye, but then I wouldn’t have gotten your coin, would I?”

Gavlo tends to his unconscious comrades, muttering under his breath as he applies his experimental poultices to their bruises. With a smirk, he charges a bucket of water with a jolt of electricity and splashes it over Vega and Sersh, jolting them awake with a gasp.

The next day, with bruises and a lingering sense of frustration, the party meets with Lady Pride—a figure Vega knows all too well—and makes arrangements to find a barge to take them south towards Yartar, leaving the mud and the blockade behind.
